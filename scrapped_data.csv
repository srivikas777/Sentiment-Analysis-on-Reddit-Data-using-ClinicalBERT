Clinical trials are research studies that help us learn about the safety and effectiveness of new medical treatments. They are conducted according to a plan, called a protocol, which describes the purpose of the study, the participants who are eligible to participate, the tests and procedures that will be performed, and the length of the study.

The basic rules of clinical trials are designed to protect the safety and rights of participants. These rules include:

* **Informed consent:** Participants must be given enough information about the study to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate. This information should include the purpose of the study, the risks and benefits of participating, and the participant's rights.
* **Independent review:** The protocol for a clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee before the study can begin. This committee is responsible for ensuring that the study is ethical and that the rights of participants are protected.
* **Randomization:** Participants in clinical trials are usually randomized to receive either the experimental treatment or a placebo (a treatment that looks like the experimental treatment but has no active ingredients). This helps to ensure that the results of the study are not biased by the participants' expectations.
* **Blinding:** In some clinical trials, the participants and the researchers who are collecting data may be blinded to which treatment the participants are receiving. This helps to prevent bias in the results of the study.
* **Data safety monitoring:** During a clinical trial, the data is monitored to ensure that the safety of the participants is not being compromised. If any safety concerns arise, the study may be stopped early.

These are just some of the basic rules that govern clinical trials. By following these rules, we can help to ensure that clinical trials are conducted ethically and that the results of these trials are reliable.

"Clinical trials are research studies that test new drugs, devices, or treatments in people to see if they are safe and effective. Clinical trials are important for finding new ways to prevent, diagnose, or treat diseases. However, clinical trials are also complicated and have strict rules and procedures.The main stages of clinical trials are:

* Preclinical research: This is when researchers test new drugs or devices in the lab or in animals to learn more about them, such as how they work, how they affect the body, and what side effects they may have. Preclinical research helps researchers decide if a new drug or device is worth testing in people.
* Phase I trials: These are the first trials that involve people, usually healthy volunteers who agree to join the study for a small payment or other benefit. Phase I trials aim to test the safety and dose of a new drug or device in a small number of people (usually 20 to 80). Phase I trials help researchers find out how the drug or device affects the body, what side effects it may have, and what dose is safe and effective.
* Phase II trials: These are trials that test how well and how safely a new drug or device works in a larger number of people (usually 100 to 300) who have the disease that the drug or device is meant to treat. Phase II trials help researchers see if the drug or device works better than a fake treatment (called a placebo) or an existing treatment, and what side effects it may have in different people.
* Phase III trials: These are trials that compare how well and how safely a new drug or device works with the best available treatment in a large number of people (usually 1,000 to 3,000) who have the disease that the drug or device is meant to treat. Phase III trials help researchers confirm if the drug or device works better than the existing treatment, what side effects it may have in different people, and what benefits and risks it may have for the general population.
* Phase IV trials: These are trials that check the long-term effects and safety of a new drug or device after it has been approved by the government and sold to the public. Phase IV trials help researchers get more information about how the drug or device works in real-life situations, how it interacts with other drugs or devices, and what rare or serious side effects it may have.

Each stage of clinical trials has its own challenges and requirements, such as planning the study design, finding and screening people who want to join the study, getting their permission, collecting and analyzing data, reporting results, and following ethical standards. Clinical trials also involve cooperation among many people, such as researchers, sponsors, government agencies, health care providers, patients, and patient groups. Clinical trials are a key part of medical progress and innovation, but they also need careful planning, execution, and oversight to ensure their quality and honesty."

"Good evening Everyone,

I just recently joined the sub-reddit, and I've been more of a casual browser on Reddit than an active user. But I reach out to you today, because as a member of this channel I'm sure we all share at least one common interest, and that's Clinical Trials. 

I myself am based out of Tokyo, and am a rookie in the field, but I am really motivated and impassioned about the topic!

My objective is simple. With people being a little more in tune with clinical trial information (COVID pushing it into the public eye and radar a lot more), I feel like this is an ideal time to make some information accessible. I'm not talking about fantastic 3 hour seminars on YouTube that industry professionals would enjoy. I'm thinking a little more PR, layman, pop-science access to the massive mountain of information and complexity that is clinical trials.  It be cool to have non-corporate・non-PR industry perspectives, or fire side chat, or dialogue, or breakdowns for people to share. 

Part of it has been planning and thinking about what people would like, or what may be easier to create, who to best reach out to, but it's been wasting valuable time. The best thing is to just start something and get the ball rolling. Hence this post to you guys (and gals) in the hopes of starting a thread of ideas, or topics, opinions, or even dissent about this idea. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading through, and leave a comment or suggestion! (Even if it's just a ""Cool ,best of luck with that"").  :)"

" Once on the market, the drug remains closely monitored. It will be monitored under real conditions of use to detect rare side effects or late complications. It can therefore be withdrawn from the market at any time. Among the many molecules tested, those concerning oncology occupy a prominent place. In this field, Canada is also participating in almost one in five trials initiated around the world.

  
**Cancer: the hope of clinical trials**

  
In Villejuif, in the Paris region, the Gustave Roussy Institute is a major center with numerous clinical trials that advance cancer research.  
Patients included in a research protocol must first sign a consent form. This document provides, among other things, informed information on the product tested, the precise course of the test and the risks of side effects.  
For the PEMBIB clinical trial, the patient first takes a blood test and an electrocardiogram. 

The results are transmitted after a few hours and if the parameters are good, the patient can receive the drug. It is tested on different types of cancers resistant to conventional care and even to some advanced treatments like immunotherapy.

  
""Immunotherapies have transformed some cancerous diseases. But unfortunately, not for a majority of patients. The current challenge is to try to make sure that some patients who do not respond to these immunotherapies alone can respond with the combination of two treatments, "". The first treatment removes the blood vessels of the tumor to allow the second treatment to penetrate better into the heart of the tumor area in order to optimize the effect of immunotherapy.

  
Nearly 70 patients participate in this research protocol. And it is thanks to these numerous clinical trials that the Gustave Roussy Institute has contributed to the development of advanced treatment in oncology: ""There are pathologies where there is therapeutic progress to be made because they are difficult to understand and to understand like cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the brain ... But by better understanding these tumors in the coming years, we will continue to progress, ""says Professor Gilles Vassal, director of clinical research.

  
Every year, more than 3,000 patients participate in clinical trials at [Clinical Research & CRO Companies Canada](https://www.biopharmaservices.com/). The Institute remains the leading center for the fight against cancer on a European scale.

  
**Epidermolysis bullosa: a life-changing clinical trial**

  
The other area very concerned by clinical trials is that of rare diseases. 95% of those affected are wandering therapeutically and only 300 curative treatments are available for 8,000 patients affected by a rare disease. These clinical trials are therefore very important.

  
The epidermolysis bullosa affects about 10,000 people in Canada, causes sores, extremely painful skin abrasions. Some forms of the disease also affect the inside of the mouth but also the esophagus, sometimes causing its narrowing with a deadly risk. Patients are currently testing an ointment in a clinical trial.

  
For this clinical trial, patients receive a daily visit from a nurse who applies the treatment and carries out the care. The mode of action of the cream remains confidential but its effects are very visible. The laboratory plans to include 80 patients in the nine countries involved in the two-year clinical trial.

  
Sick or healthy, anyone can be asked to participate in a clinical trial. This proposal can occur during a consultation with the doctor, but also by an announcement in the media. You can also volunteer independently, by contacting structures dedicated to clinical research, such as Inserm's clinical investigation centers (CIC) for example."
"There are different types of clinical trials including the ones that follow.

The **clinical trials** to assess new treatments or new ways to make them more effective existing treatments. You can study new drugs or new methods to perform surgery or administer radiotherapy, for example. This is the type of clinical trial in which people with cancer participate most frequently.

The **prevention trials** to assess new ways to reduce the risk of cancer or prevent it from reappearing.

The **screening trials** help to find ways to detect cancer early in humans, before they experience symptoms.

The **diagnostic tests** used to find better ways to diagnose cancer or to determine the stage.

The **trials supportive care** possible to find ways to improve comfort and quality of life for people with cancer or cancer survivors.

## Phases of a clinical trial

The clinical trial that involves a new treatment always takes place in several stages called phases. Each phase is designed to answer specific questions. The following are the most common phases of a cancer clinical trial, as per [Canada Contract Research Organization](https://www.biopharmaservices.com/).

In **phase 1** , a new treatment is often evaluated for the first time in humans. This helps to know how safe it is and what is the best dose to administer. The Phase 1 trial is usually offered to people with advanced cancer who no longer respond to treatment or who have no other treatment options. In general, 15 to 30 people participate in the phase 1 trial.

In **Phase 2** , the degree of effectiveness of a treatment against a certain type of cancer is demonstrated. The extent to which the treatment is safe and the possible side effects continue to be assessed. In general, fewer than 100 people participate in the Phase 2 trial.

In **Phase 3** , a promising new treatment is compared to standard therapy, which is the recognized treatment that is generally given for a condition or illness. Researchers especially want to know if the new treatment is better than the standard treatment. People from around the world can participate in a Phase 3 trial. In general, the number of participants ranges from several hundred to several thousand.

In **Phase 4** , more information is collected on the possible effects of treatment, whether good or bad, after its use has been approved in Canada. In general, several hundred to several thousand people participate in the phase 4 trial.

## Randomized clinical trials

The clinical trial can be designed to include different groups. Most of the time, there are 2 groups, but you can count more. One group is the control group, that is, the participants do not receive the study treatment. The other group is the experimental group, that is, the participants receive the treatment under study.

To make sure groups can be compared, it's a computer that randomly assigns each person to a group. You are as lucky to be part of the experimental group as the control group. This is called randomization.

There are 2 types of randomization.

For **blind randomization** , researchers know who is in the experimental group and who is in the control group, but study participants are unaware of this. This prevents them from doing things that could affect the results of the study.

For **double-blind randomization, trial** participants do not know which group they belong to, just like the researchers. In the field of science, the design of this study seems to be the best since neither researchers nor participants can affect the results of the study by doing things they think they should do depending on the group.

## Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials

Placebo is a pill or injection that looks like the tested substance but has no action at all. Administering a placebo to one of the clinical trial groups allows the researchers to compare the new placebo treatment. No placebo is administered instead of effective standard therapy. In a trial, for example, a new treatment associated with standard treatment with a placebo associated with the standard treatment can be compared. This tells researchers if the new treatment is effective.

Placebo is given in double-blind trials. You will be told if a trial is using a placebo, but you will not know if you are in the placebo group or the researchers elsewhere."

"John Bain(AKA TotalBiscuit) is a truly amazing person who unfortunately has been suffering from bowel cancer for the last four years. He's kept it at bay so far due to chemotherapy, alas the chemo treatments recently stopped working and now his liver is said to be failing. He has been trying to get into clinical trials but so far he's been turned down due to them being uncomfortable taking on someone in his condition.

I was wondering if anyone on here knows of any clinical trials that would be willing to take John?  I know this is a longshot and the odds for him are not great, but I figured it was at least worth a try.

>\[N\]ew therapies are approved in wealthy countries and then slowly leak out to low- and middle-income countries, many years later. In the case of gene therapy, that means countries most affected by a disease such as sickle cell may wait decades to access a curative therapy.

>For the last few years, a handful of researchers in the U.S. and around the world have tried to find ways of ensuring global access to these technologies. In 2020, they [formed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00284-4) the Global Gene Therapy Initiative, with an initial goal of setting up a gene therapy clinical trial for a hemoglobinopathy — such as a disease like sickle cell or beta thalassemia — or HIV in two different low- and middle-income countries by 2024.

>That hasn’t quite happened, but a trial is underway in [India](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-conducted-1st-human-clinical-trials-for-haemophilia-a-gene-therapy-science-and-technology-minister-9187016/) for hemophilia A and Uganda is set to begin its own study later this year. India and Brazil have also invested in developing their own [CAR-T treatments for cancer](https://www.statnews.com/2022/01/14/cancer-cart-cell-therapy-research/).

Read [here](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/09/jennifer-adair-hutch-cancer-center-gene-therapy-global-access/), STAT Reporter's interview with Jennifer Adair, who develops scalable, low-cost gene therapies at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and helped found the Global Gene Therapy Initiative. Regarding **key initiatives of Global Gene Therapy** to ensure global access, Adair said, they are enabling countries to build the infrastructure because of ""many different geopolitical structures and scientific and translational gaps.""

>*-- ""It starts with no one here can decide what should go someplace else or how it should happen. We created a platform whereby interested parties and countries could self-nominate. There are a lot of barriers just to participate. There are certain countries in Africa right now that have five-year waiting lists for a tourist visa to come to the U.S., which means they’re not going to be able to attend this conference for five years.*

"For first-in-human (FIH) oncology studies, the investigational product doses are generally chosen as follows:

* **Small molecules** FIH doses at **one-tenth of STD10** (STD10 is dose severely toxic in 10% of rodents in preclinical studies) or at **one-sixth of HNSTD** (HNSTD is highest non-severely toxic dose in animal model)
* For **biologics** such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or immune-activating products (e.g. CD3 chimeras), a variety of approaches are considered, e.g., dosing based on pharmacologic active dose (**PAD**), minimally anticipated biological effect level (**MABEL**) approach. MABEL uses in vitro and/or in vivo data, considers activity or target occupancy, and may include modeling (e.g. pharmacokinetics \[PK\] modeling).

In a recent [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230024000576) in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, FDA scientists reviewed PK models used by sponsors to support the FIH doses of immune-oncology (IO) products provided in the INDs. The scientists reviewed data from 41 products including mAbs, bispecific antibodies (bis-Abs), and CD3 multi-specific constructs (CD3). The findings and conclusions were:

* The sponsors’ PK models were diverse in methods, assumptions and assigned variables.
* The traditional approaches (NOAEL, HNSTD) for FIH dose selection may not be applicable to IA products.
* FIH dose selection of IA products is **based on the totality of data**. Although FDA accepts the approach of using PK models, FDA review teams also consider other data.
* **A simple PK model (SPM) using clearance (CL) for scaling in FIH dose selection of IA products was considered appropriate**, recognizing that it may not result in optimal FIH doses. CD3 constructs were more sensitive than mAbs to changes in the model's variables. Variables should be carefully selected for CD3 constructs.
* **Safety margins** (i.e., ratio of doses given to humans in clinical trials to PK-based proposed FIH doses) were 4- to 600-fold for CD3 constructs (using relevant and/or sensitive activity assays) and 150- to 36,000-fold for mAbs (using the mean EC50s) in this dataset.
* For mAbs, clinical data of closely related products may inform FIH dose selection. Appropriate margins may be needed. For PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs, using products’ in vitro EC50 in the model resulted in suboptimal FIH doses and clinical data of closely related products informed FIH dose selection.
* The authors could not make conclusions on the use of mouse data in the model due to insufficient number of products containing both the NHP and mouse data.

"Hi guys! I first wanted to thank you all for the amount of support so many of you guys have shown me on my threads about my 6 year old. It seriously means so much to me and her. 

And a little update: Nora was hospitalized Wednesday, prepped on Thursday, and had her scope around noon today. She’s doing great. This girl was ALL smiles and giggles heading into the OR, you would’ve thought we were sending her to Disney :) Her GI came out afterwards and told me that while things do look improved (yay!), unfortunately not enough to keep her on the Entyvio clinical trial. He is recommending Rinvoq or Xeljanz as next steps. Just looking on Google (I know I know) this looks absolutely terrifying. But I 100% trust our GI. I have a couple questions for any of you who may know or have experience with either of these 2 medications:

1) Did it work?

2) Side effects? I’m used to the scary looking cancer side effects, as she’s been on Remicade & Entyvio before. But this looks even scarier.

3) Please don’t judge me for asking this. Is there any (promising) data out there on pregnancy/conception for these 2 drugs? Everywhere I look just says “could cause harm based on animal studies, not known for sure.”  I know I’m probably insane… she’s 6 years old, still has a loooong ways to go, she might not even want a family in the future. Which is completely fine. But I really want that door to be open for her, if she so chooses. 

Thank you for reading my ramble :) Any insight would be very appreciated ❤️

">!What if Mike never went to Prison?!<

>!One of the big plot points later on in Suits was when Mike finally got outed for his secret of having never been to Harvard or any Law School and going to prison for fraud, the one responsible for this was Anita Gibbs and she was seen multiple times after Mike went to Prison, most notably she was on the Character and Fitness committee for the New York Bar in Season 6's finale.!<

>!But one thing I've been asking myself is what would've happened if Mike had not gone to prison in Season 5. Now one scenario I could see is Mike actually trusting Harvey and the trial proceeds with the jury returning a not guilty verdict.!<

>!However, with everything on the line I believe Harvey would've been more than willing to try and get the jury to believe that Anita was attempting to force Mike to commit perjury. Towards the end of the trial, originally when Mike confessed to being a fraud. He would instead tell the jury that Anita Gibbs had told him to lie in court and tell the jury he was a fraud, and Harvey would likely have someone testify that this was the case.!<

>!In the end, Mike would still be found not guilty, Anita would likely lose her career and become an adversary to the firm. This would mean Mike isn't in prison for Season 6 but would likely not go back to Pearson Specter, because before his arrest Mike had resigned so it's likely that he would potentially find himself working at the clinic a little earlier.!<

>!But those are my rough thoughts, I honestly think there were several ways that Mike could've gotten out of going to prison. !<"

"I did this study yesterday and am reporting back now in case anyone else is interested. It's being done at the Medstar hospital in DC that's run by Georgetown University. Here's the link: [Study Details | Vaginal Injection of Platelet Rich Plasma for Sexual Function | ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05769283?term=sexual%20health&intr=PRP&rank=7)

Essentially, participants will get a blood draw and then get 3 separate injections in the upper vaginal wall. The shots will either be platelet rich plasma (from the blood draw) or saline (the control). Patients don't know which treatment they are receiving.

My big disclaimer for anyone interested is that they don't actually use topical lidocaine like the study posting said. The doctor who did the shots for me said they decided to not use lidocaine because the area of the vagina they inject isn't very sensitive, and that most of the pain would be from the liquid of the injection stretching the skin, which lidocaine apparently wouldn't be helpful for.

I was nervous when I heard that but decided to go through with it anyways in case I was getting the PRP. It ended up being very painful (at least a 5/10 for me) and I was surprised by how much I bled. When she took the speculum out I felt the blood come pulsing down my butt for a couple seconds and there was a decent-sized puddle under me when I got up. The doctor said most patients bleed a little and report their pain level as a 3 or 4, so maybe I am an outlier but I kind of doubt it. 

If anyone on here decides to do the study, I would absolutely recommend bringing your own lidocaine if you have it. I think the study is a great idea in theory; I just think they should have planned better for the pain management aspect. Hopefully if PRP starts being used as a treatment in regular gyn settings they will use lidocaine or nerve blocks as a standard pain management!"

"* \[Note: American pronunciation is required in the telling of this joke.\]
* \[Also Note: Any resemblance to actual events or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.\]
* \[Last note: Phycology is the study of algae, also known as algology.\]

Once upon a time, there were three friends that were fascinated by the properties of algae. When they grew up, they all pursued careers as phycologists, scientists that studied algae. All three becaame very prominent in their chosen field, and soon they were competing amongst each other to find a cure for cancer using their own proprietary genetically-modified algae.

The first scientist, Dr. Cole, loved his beautiful Tesla Model X, and when he came up with his first batch of cancer-curing algae, he called it ""Algae Strain X"".

Not to be outdone, the second scientist, Dr. Lamar, who owned a Model Y, called his genetically-modified version ""Algae Strain Y"".

Naturally, the third scientist, Dr. Drake, (who didn't own a Tesla), simply called his creation ""Algae Strain Z"".

These algae strains all went to clinical trials at about the same time, and each scientist hoped that their strain of algae would be the cancer-busting winner. After many moons, the clinical trials revealed that Strain-X was no better than a placebo, Strain-Y actually did help cure some specific cancers, and Algae Strain-Z didn't do anything for cancer but had a peculiar side effect of immediately calming down very angry people.

Eventually, Dr. Lamar, who produced the cancer-curing Algae-Y, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018. Even though Dr. Cole and Dr. Drake were passed over by the Nobel Committee, all three remained the leading scientists and maintained continued fame in the world of phycology.

One day, while Dr. Cole was being interviewed for a scholarly article in the prestigious Journal of Applied Phycology, he remarked that he and the two scientists were the original ""Big Three"" in phycology.

Now, Dr. Lamar, the Nobel laureate, got very upset when he read this in the papers. He was, after all, the only Nobel prize winner in phycology and felt he had no equals. As such, Dr. Lamar fired back in the next publication of the journal, stating that HE was the biggest in phycology and that there was ""no big three - it's just big me"". Additionally, he called Dr. Drake's calm-inducing Algae-Z ""a light pack"" and should be buried in the ""algae cemetery"".

At this point, Dr. Cole decided to be the better man and bowed out of the dispute and declined to comment, admitting his comment was ""goofy"".

Dr. Drake, however, would not take Dr. Lamar's insults lying down. In the next edition of the Journal of Applied Phycology, he published an article poking fun at Dr. Lamar's short stature and manliness, and stated he needed to do more push-ups.

Upon reading the Dr. Drake's hurtful comments, Dr. Lamar then publicy accused Dr. Drake of having an affair with his lab assistant and fathering an illegitimate daughter.

Now, little did the phycology world know how true this was. Dr. Drake had a lab assistant, Beatrice, with whom he had loved for many years, in a relationship lasting longer than his marriage. However, he never married Beatrice because she had a hugely violent temper, and would get terribly angry at the slightest problems. While Beatrice would not make a good wife, Dr. Drake still maintained her as a lover, and his love was reciprocated. Beatrice truly loved Dr. Drake with all her heart, even while bringing up their daughter alone.

When the clinical trials concluded, while Beatrice and Dr. Drake were disappointed that their Algae-Z did not cure cancer, it did at least have another application of soothing and calming people with bad tempers. Beatrice recognised that she wasn't the most even-keeled of people, and often took a dose of Algae Strain Z whenever she felt her anger building up. It soon became a private joke amongst these two lovebirds that when she got angry, Dr. Drake would tell her to ""Be like Algae-Z"" in a reference to the algae's soothing nature. Very soon, Beatrice was learning to calm her anger simply by listening to her lover's magical words, without actually having to be dependent on the drug.

Now, during the heated exchange between Dr. Drake and Dr. Lamar, Beatrice's patience was truly tested. She lost her cool everytime Dr. Lamar published a damning article against the love of her life, Dr. Drake. In order for Dr. Drake to hush her during her bouts of uncontrollable fury, Dr. Drake would whisper his magic words to Beatrice, which now calmed her so well she didn't actually need to take Algae-Z.

Naturally, when when Beatrice read the most recent Journal which accused Dr. Drake of fathering an illegitimate child, she naturally was furious and started on a rampage around the lab, not being able to control her temper.

Dr. Lamar, knowing that his magical words had a very powerful soothing effect on Beatrice's anger, stopped her, and said, >!""Bee, be Algae-Z""!<"

After many moons, the clinical trials revealed that Strain-X was no better than a placebo, Strain-Y actually did help cure some specific cancers, and Algae Strain-Z didn't do anything for cancer but had a peculiar side effect of immediately calming down very angry people.

Eventually, Dr. Lamar, who produced the cancer-curing Algae-Y, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018. Even though Dr. Cole and Dr. Drake were passed over by the Nobel Committee, all three remained the leading scientists and maintained continued fame in the world of phycology.

One day, while Dr. Cole was being interviewed for a scholarly article in the prestigious Journal of Applied Phycology, he remarked that he and the two scientists were the original ""Big Three"" in phycology.

Now, Dr. Lamar, the Nobel laureate, got very upset when he read this in the papers. He was, after all, the only Nobel prize winner in phycology and felt he had no equals. As such, Dr. Lamar fired back in the next publication of the journal, stating that **HE** was the biggest in phycology and that there was ""no big three - it's just big me"". Additionally, he called Dr. Drake's calm-inducing Algae-Z ""a light pack"" and should be buried in the ""algae cemetery"".

At this point, Dr. Cole decided to be the better man and bowed out of the dispute and declined to comment, admitting his comment was ""goofy"".

Dr. Drake, however, would not take Dr. Lamar's insults lying down. In the next edition of the Journal of Applied Phycology, he published an article poking fun at Dr. Lamar's short stature and manliness, and stated he needed to do more push-ups.

Upon reading the Dr. Drake's hurtful comments, Dr. Lamar then publicy accused Dr. Drake of having an affair with his lab assistant and fathering an illegitimate daughter.

Now, little did the phycology world know how true this was. Dr. Drake had a lab assistant, Beatrice, with whom he had loved for many years, in a relationship lasting longer than his marriage. However, he never married Beatrice because she had a hugely violent temper, and would get terribly angry at the slightest problems. While Beatrice was not wife material, Dr. Drake still maintained her as a lover, and his love was reciprocated. Beatrice truly loved Dr. Drake with all her heart, even while bringing up their daughter alone.

When the clinical trials concluded, while Beatrice and Dr. Drake were disappointed that their Algae-Z did not cure cancer, it did at least have a wonderful side-effect of soothing and calming people with bad tempers. Beatrice recognised that she wasn't the most even-keeled of people, and often took a dose of Algae Strain Z whenever she felt her anger building up. It soon became a private joke amongst these two lovebirds that when she got angry, Dr. Drake would tell her to ""Be like Algae-Z"" in a reference to the algae's soothing nature. Very soon, Beatrice was learning to calm her anger simply by listening to her lover's magical words, without actually having to be dependent on the drug.

Now, during the heated exchange between Dr. Drake and Dr. Lamar, Beatrice's patience was truly tested. She lost her cool everytime Dr. Lamar published a damning article against the love of her life, Dr. Drake. In order for Dr. Drake to hush her during her bouts of uncontrollable fury, Dr. Drake would whisper his magic words to Beatrice, which now calmed her so well she didn't actually need to take Algae-Z.

Naturally, when when Beatrice read the most recent Journal which accused Dr. Drake of fathering an illegitimate child, she became furious and started on a rampage around the lab, not being able to control her temper.

Dr. Lamar, knowing that his magical words had a powerful soothing effect on Beatrice's anger, stopped her in her tracks, and said, >!""Bee, be Algae-Z"".!<"

NRx Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq:NRXP) Announces Final Clinical Trial Results: Superior Safety Combined with Similar Efficacy in the Trial of NRX-101 Compared to Lurasidone in Suicidal Bipolar Depression
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nrx-pharmaceuticals-nasdaq-nrxp-announces-123000838.html"
"I was perceived Zoloft a couple years ago with the intention that I make a decision on trying it out. I’m not a medication person nor do I have anything against it or judge people on it. I just don’t want to be dependent on medication and have read a lot of posts of people just feeling numb and emotionless. 

That said, I recently came across an article about TMS. After contacting the clinic and finding out that they won’t charge me for the treatment due to it being a trial study I was pretty happy because I hear it can be pricy (this is a well known hospital in my city by the way not something shady) 

Anyway, I ended up being rejected for the treatment for the only reason that I am not on medication. They said that TMS isn’t an “A” solution nor is it a “B” it’s something that they say you should try after seeing a psychotherapist first, then trying medication and then TMS. 

I explained that my issue with this is that I don’t want to be on medication so that’s why I wanted to try TMS. Also, how would we know what’s working if I’m taking medication as well as doing the TMS treatment.

They then said that this is part of the criteria for the trial so if I was interested, then I would need to try medication for about 4 to 6 weeks and then be reassessed by them and be on the medication at the same time of the treatment. 

Having said all this, I just wanted to see if anyone has experienced TMS while being on Zoloft. 

I’m seriously considering starting at this point because I’m sick and tired of feeling the way I’m feeling. I just hope if I do try the medication and it does start to help with these feelings, I could be one of those people who come off and don’t feel dependent on it. 

Thanks in advanced,

"I’m CRC gone rogue and I have teamed up with my PI to leave our current site in university hospital to create completely new site dedicated for multiple sites and studies. 
We will have access to almost unlimited infrastructure and devices. 
We’ve been in this industry for years and have quite clear idea how site work in our country, but we want to elevate our standards even higher. Therefore we teamed up with private LLC that will provide us with anything necessary.

And now I feel overwhelmed from the possibilities and I’m asking for your opinion as CROs and Sponsors, and Sites- how do YOU see the ideal site for clinical research? What devices would give us advantage, what infrastructure would be more convenient. How many nurses are usually needed in bigger sites? (In our experience we usually had 1-2 nurses that were overworked and never had time for new studies). Is there anything we definitely should avoid? 

To conclude that, I hope to create an environment for successful trials, that is capable to perform any type of trials and would also attract more medical field workers and of course-patients. "

"Do you know what killed 106,000 people in the United States in just one year? 

In 2021, that many people died from drug-involved overdoses including illegal drugs and prescription opioids (over 75%), according to [data](https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The worst part about these statistics is the fact that the number of overdose deaths in 2021 was over six times the number in 1999. In just one year alone, from 2020 to 2021 the number of drug overdose deaths increased by more than 16%. 

How did this happen? What led to such a serious crisis in the United States? Are there any alternatives to opioid pain medicine that can help curb these devastating rates? 

While the answer to the first question is complex with various experts in the field agreeing that a multi-system failure of regulation, including over-prescribing, big pharma power and politics played an important part, the answer to the second one might be a bit simpler. Over the past several years, there have been studies showing medical marijuana's potential in various pain treatments, while also revealing it can help curb opioid use. 

For example, the largest-ever Canadian-supported study published in January viewed 90 randomized controlled trials involving 22,028 participants. The research concluded that marijuana provided similar [pain relief benefits as opioids but without negative consequences](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/01/36578723/huge-study-reveals-cannabis-provides-similar-pain-relief-benefits-as-opioids-without-negative-co). 

Benzinga wanted to learn more about cannabis as an alternative to opioids and other medical marijuana benefits, so we reached out to **Robin Fowler M.D**., a board-certified anesthesiologist with a fellowship in pain management from Emory University in Atlanta. Fowler is also a founder of **Botanical Sciences**, a physician**–**owned medical marijuana dispensary where a team of physicians prescribe cannabis over traditional opioids for pain management. 

""After treating pain patients in an outpatient surgery setting for 10 years, I was ready to explore new ways to help my patients,"" Fowler told Benzinga. ""The Georgia Cannabis Program gave me the opportunity to do just that, allowing me to treat patients' chronic pain with THC. From there, Botanical Sciences was born and we're now producing medical cannabis at our 130,000 square foot manufacturing facility in South Georgia."" 

What sets apart Botanical Sciences from other dispensaries is that it’s Georgia's first physician-owned medical marijuana provider that is vertically integrated from seed to sale, he explained. 

""We cultivate, process, distribute, and dispense all from our facility in Glennville, Georgia. We take the most scientific healthcare approach using evidence-based formulations in our products that are most beneficial to the patients.""

Fowler's first experience with medical marijuana was during his shoulder reconstruction surgery, when as a physician becoming a patient he was able to appreciate an alternative to opioids even more. His first educational experience was at a pain fellowship in 2005 where the ""learning curve took off once the medical program became closer to fruition in Georgia,"" Fowler recalled. 

""The properties of medical cannabis for medical implications are in the early stages of being utilized as a therapeutic modality. We are fortunate to have a Schedule A license with a patient pool of 20,000 to further our current studies. Throughout the last fifteen years of practice, I wish it was an available option as I consider any reduction in opioid use a success."" 

# 20-40% Reduction In Opioid Use

How helpful is cannabis in reducing opioid use? 

**""**Overall, medical cannabis use supports a 30-40% reduction in opioid consumption,"" says Fowler. ""Not only does it control patients’ pain but it is also beneficial for gastrointestinal and pulmonary function."" 

Fowler is also working on opioid reduction investigations and ways to determine the origin of a patient’s pain. 

""The electronic medical record kept on pain patients since 2007 gives us a great data pool to do analysis. With over 20,000 patients, we're able to cross reference medical cannabis impact on Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME). Additionally, other significant areas useful for patients and clinicians include all-risk surgeries performed, back pain, medical cannabis and implants. These areas have been vastly under-studied and I hope we can provide some valuable information."" 

Aside from pain management, what else can medical marijuana potentially treat?

In the state of Georgia, there are 17 health conditions that can qualify a patient for medical marijuana treatment. Among these are cancer, neuromuscular diseases, Sickle cell disease, autism spectrum disorder, AIDS, PTSD, and more. Fowler adds that, ""there is a growing need for medical cannabis to be used to treat insomnia, some gastrointestinal diseases, and other debilitating conditions."" 

*See Also:* [*Most Important Medical Potential Of Marijuana? Cannabis For Pain Relief Says Biotech CEO*](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/12/36298034/most-important-medical-potential-of-marijuana-cannabis-for-pain-relief-says-biotech-ceo)

# A Thin Line 

While the marijuana industry is often broken into two markets – medical and recreational, some experts believe that the line is thinner than it may seem at first glance. This is because the majority of recreational users are actually consuming it to deal with various conditions whether extreme or mild. Fowler agrees that the line is very thin, explaining that many people nowadays self-diagnose with the help of the internet. 

**""**That being said, when somebody has a condition such as pain or anxiety, they can treat that with over-the-counter products and that creates a very parallel situation with cannabis, specifically THC. Then as diagnoses become more complex, such as neurological and psychiatric disorders, I believe medical professionals are best utilized to guide patients. This requires education and experience with medical professionals which are improving each day."" 

While Fowler doesn't see cannabis becoming its own boarded-specialty, like internal medicine, he thinks requiring certifications and expert knowledge would be likely. He says he’d be delighted to see more education on shared research and clinical experience. 

""I think there needs to be more emphasis on generating awareness and educating the public on the benefits of cannabis in treating disease and other debilitating conditions,"" Fowler concluded. "
"# ""Abstract

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of *APOE4* homozygosity on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by examining its clinical, pathological and biomarker changes to see whether *APOE4* homozygotes constitute a distinct, genetically determined form of AD. Data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center and five large cohorts with AD biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis included 3,297 individuals for the pathological study and 10,039 for the clinical study. Findings revealed that almost all ***APOE4*** homozygotes exhibited AD pathology and had significantly higher levels of AD biomarkers from age 55 compared to *APOE3* homozygotes. The study concludes that *APOE4* homozygotes represent a genetic form of AD, suggesting the need for individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials and treatments.""

If you are at an increased risk for Alzheimer’s, the key is to **use this knowledge to do all that you can to decrease your risk.**

Number one on my list for preventing Alzheimer’s is blocking blue light at night to boost melatonin and help with circadian rhythm.

There is a ton of research showing a **strong connection between circadian rhythm disruption, melatonin production, insulin regulation, and healthy brain aging**.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4200827/)\]\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29318587)\]\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29217196)\]\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28890168)\]

Our natural circadian rhythm causes melatonin to rise in the evening and stay elevated until morning. Light in the shorter, blue wavelengths signals through receptors in our eyes to turn off melatonin production in the morning.

However, our modern environment with electric lights at night, especially TVs and phones, disrupts our natural circadian rhythm.

You can either block blue light with 100% blue-light-blocking glasses or simply avoid electronics and bright overhead light for a couple of hours before sleep. 📷Blue-blocking glasses, worn in the evening for several hours before bed, increase natural melatonin production by about 50% in just two weeks.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101797)\]

*What about supplemental melatonin?*  
Clinical trials are also evaluating the use of melatonin supplements for Alzheimer’s.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294066)\] Additionally, melatonin has been shown to positively reduce any increase in cardiovascular disease risk associated with the APOE E4 allele.\[[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37625682/)\]

"""What do we have Mr. Franklin?""  and he answered, ""We have a republic, if we can keep it.""   

Benjamin Franklin knew that the republic our forefathers created was not perfect in and of its own.  No, he realized that there was a certain necessary ingredient that makes it work as intended.  He would recognize that by taking a look at where we are today.  Had it worked as intended, everyone could not be out for themselves like it is right now.

When George Washington was leaving the presidency he said, ""The foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of morality.""  ""Of all the dispositions and habits, which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are the support.""

The necessary ingredient which Franklin was referring to which was necessary to keep the republic was spoken through the lips of George Washington.  Morality and  a respect for religion.  According to our forefathers, morality was absolutely integral and fundamental for the republic government to function as planned. 

How did we end up here?  Have we ever lived this way before?  Was it ever as dangerous just to go into the city as it is today?  We are in a different world today.  People protest about absolutely nothing and then come inside with guns a blazing and shoot.  It gets crazier by the day.

But the good news is that the games which people play do come to an end.

Leronlimab's [Gagging](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1c96auz/tomfoolery/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) has come to an end as the Imposed Holds were lifted, but the aftereffects cannot be denied.  CytoDyn has defended and won back leronlimab's rights to be used in trials across the country, but it is [slow going](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1bwdtzv/silently_converging/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) at best, and more akin to walking on broken glass.  

---

The Fundamentals

Leronlimab has the power to deal with the symptoms of disease as well as to [augment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1ao96rf/standing_tall_and_confident/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) our Immune System to heal completely from the disease.  Leronlimab operates at the heart, at the root of the problems we face.  Leronlimab doesn't just deal with the disease superficially, rather, its mechanism of action occurs right where the disease begins, right at the root of the problem.  [Step One Complete](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/170cil8/no_detours/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  The need to develop a drug that cures without creating further complications was accomplished.

As for Step 2, it just went down from there.  The next rung of the ladder was downward.  The means by which the proof of the drug's effectiveness is established; the laws by which it proves itself; well, those ways, means and laws were broken.  The [parameters](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/18p350m/122021_dr_lalezari_presentation_to_nih/) of the trials being changed last minute.  Given as an ultimatum in a take it or leave it situation, CytoDyn was literally left with no other choice, but to be forced into accepting the new parameters, regardless that the drug was placed at great disadvantage.

So, this gets to the ""root"" of the problem.  Laws broken.  The ways and means, the lawlessness that occurred and the drug was squashed.  What about the [omission](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/yndfkd/the_manifestation_of_truth_delivers_a_tried_true/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of vast volumes of uncompleted data in the final BLA submission made to the FDA.  Isn't that another example of breaking laws of standard operating procedures?  You don't do that.

Integrity means you do the right thing.  Anything other than the right thing, is the wrong thing.  Therefore, [Integrity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1agrcau/what_does_interim_executives_have_to_offer_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is the root.  Integrity was lost and laws were broken.  They did the wrong thing.  Integrity, [Morality](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/122pjr7/point_of_no_return/), these are the missing ingredient which Franklin was referring to, which Washington understood to be absolutely necessary for the proper functioning of the republic.  

>""This was a portion of Cyrus’ original speech during 9/28/22 Conference Call:

>“*6:50 Dr. Cyrus Arman. Thank you Tanya, and good afternoon everyone.* ***A moral obligation to generate therapies to improve people's lives; A focused and disciplined clinical development strategy; A value generating path resulting in economic returns for our investors. This is CytoDyn's mission.***""  

Integrity was necessary to make the republic last and is also what is necessary for leronlimab to be successful.  Why?  Because leronlimab has what it takes to be successful.  In and of itself, the drug accomplishes what it sets out to do and that is cure disease.  But man is inherently wicked.

If Integrity doesn't exist, then lawlessness does.  How was the decision ever made to not fully complete the BLA before it was submitted?  Were they somehow thinking that the FDA would just allow a new form of incomplete BLA submission?  Or did they believe that the FDA was just as corrupt as those responsible for assembling, compiling and reviewing the submission of the BLA?  Did Amarex believe they were just playing a game, and could do as they pleased?  Were they under the impression that there was never any possible way for this drug to make it as far as it did, so why even bother with the effort of BLA assembly?  They were receiving payments.   Were they convinced that CytoDyn would just go out of business before the BLA would ever have to be submitted?  Maybe Amarex was never ever a believer.  

Unlike Amarex, CytoDyn was not of zero faith; nor was IncellDx.  Bruce Patterson had tremendous belief and so did NP.    Possibly the FDA had no faith, and they might have got that sense of disbelief from KK, as it was him, they were directly dealing with, because, instead of working with the FDA, NP was hiding in the shadows.  Regardless, both the FDA and Amarex had to trial the drug according to the principles of fairness regardless of what they believed or thought.  Had Amarex believed in the drug, had they believed in the company of CytoDyn, then they would not have done what they did.  Maybe they thought that everything would be gone by the time the submission of the BLA became necessary, this way there would be no need to work at all on the data because it never would make it to the point of submission.  But CytoDyn was unaware of such thinking and through NP's [unwarranted trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1cdjqym/wild_honey/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), CytoDyn gave Amarex unfettered freedom.

Back to the original intent.  For the sake of Humanity, it was necessary for the drug to reach a new level in medicine, the next level of medicinal treatment.  The plan for leronlimab to forge that transition from old medicine to a new form of medicine certainly was feasible because leronlimab was the most perfect drug designed perfectly for that very important purpose.  But the individuals who were at work driving this game were irresponsible and wicked.  Every one of them lacked Integrity.  Yet, these men were charged with the responsibility to deliver this next level, next generation drug to all of Humanity.  These individuals were somehow recklessly inclined to pervert the inherent freedom allotted to those given such an undertaking.  Therefore, look now at the roots of their hearts.  How were they bred?

As I said before, the most important part of the problem already was solved.  That, of course was the creation of leronlimab.  The drug [performs](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/y5ojkm/ccl5ccr5_axis_in_human_diseases_and_related/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) at a level that exceeds current medicine.  Even at levels that men are still trying to come to grips with, to grasp an understanding of.  And man shall come to understand more completely and shall come to grips with the wonders of its capacity and what they learn and discover surely shall not cease to amaze.  

However, in the beginning, the medicine was unfortunately placed in the hands of men who lacked Integrity.  It was trialed by a CRO that had no faith or belief in the drug they trialed, or no faith in the sponsor of those trials that the trials would definitely fail and fail they would.  In addition, the company was created as an OTC stock, making it exceedingly susceptible to the attacks of short sellers.  All of this was brought together, [Rube Goldberg](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/10mapwa/distillation_of_the_divide/) fashion, in an effort to get leronlimab delivered to Humanity.  However, the last ingredient required to make this effort a success, was a deep-seated motivation and zeal that it should come to reality.  An absolute, deep-seated, adamant adherence and commitment to absolutely everything necessary to making such an effort successful.  But someone, somewhere, somehow, dropped the ball and lost that ingredient.

These people instead started thinking with their pocketbooks instead of with their hearts, minds and conscious.  All involved had to have a passion for the mission, checked by restraint, by laws, which had to be upheld as if they were the rule of the land.  From the outside, it appeared as if it could work.  The company was up and running; trials were getting done, just not [resulted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/18f4vjq/signs/), (why not?)  (shouldn't that have given off some clues that something was inherently wrong?).  Shares were being traded and share were being shorted.  Sub-contractors were getting hired and fired almost on a daily basis.  It all appeared legit, but things were not even close to being perfect.  Later on though, we started seeing Ambulance Chasers.  Then the synchronized short attacks.  However, a big blow came when FDA imposed the clinical hold.  Shouldn't the FDA have already had evidence that leronlimab was safe?  Why didn't the FDA have that [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/user/MGK_2/comments/14i4ctg/fair_and_square/)?  Why wasn't that information already in the hands of the FDA?

That information should have been supplied to the FDA by those collecting that information, Amarex.  But, instead, they decided that they would blow that all off and conceal that data, even preventing access to it, despite still collecting wages regardless.  Why did they do that?  Were they living according to the law of the jungle, setting traps, stalking?  Survive by anyway you know how?  They could not have believed in the drug.  They only wanted free money.  Amarex knew what they had to do.  They had no faith and no love for the purpose.  They cared only for their pockets.  In addition, they must have hated doing whatever they were doing.  Unfortunately, it was exactly that which they were hired for, but CytoDyn never confirmed Amarex's zeal to make this work.  CytoDyn failed to realize that in fact, Amarex actually hated leronlimab and also hated CytoDyn.  Amarex loved only Amarex, but CytoDyn handed them the work anyway.

So, this grand solution to Humanity's problem was and still is dependent upon a foundation of morality and integrity.  Both morality and integrity do produce an adamant adherence to the mission.  Without these two virtues, this solution to Humanity's problem would be doomed to fail, and this was not realized at the outset, otherwise, it never would have been entrusted into incapable hands. And it did just about completely fail, but [miraculously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/18pxxwm/slowly_but_surely_it_becomes_undeniable/), it has persisted.  Today, it is in [better hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/18p2nd4/the_comeback_kid/).  That awakening occurred over the past few years.  

Amarex needed to find a way to hide the data of the trial and to keep the data away from CytoDyn.  They did that by formatting the data in non-approved, non-standard methods.  They gave the ownership of that data to yet another company, despite the fact that the data was owned by CytoDyn.  

NP knew only one tactic.  He depended on the spewing of his knowledge and on getting the word out regarding leronlimab.  His philosophy was to speak up at every available moment.  He carried it too far though.  NP operated without rules.  He was way outside the box.  He operated in ways no public company should have.  There was no order.  There was no restraint.  Human nature ruled.  Deceitful and desperately wicked.  and he told himself and all of us that he was a good person.  Who could know it?  His reasoning was flawed, it was incorrect.  And this too was at the root of the downfall.  It ran rampant and unchecked.  

The solution has arisen.  Those that love the law are in charge now.  There is order now.  It has been restored.  There is [Freedom](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/11fq4rj/turning_point/) now, but there is also restraint.  They have freedom, but they operate with restraint.  When NP originally bought leronlimab, it was like he bought the car, then, he reached into the glove box and found the owner's manual, then threw it immediately in the street and said, ""I don't need no owner's manual, this is my car, I run it the way I want to.""  He drove leronlimab without an owner's manual, damn near into the ground.  Things fell apart.  Why?  Because he threw the manual away.  

Lalezari is more considerate of the missing link.  Integrity.  Morality.  Lalezari has a deep respect for authority as both he and his father are physicians, bred appropriately, and he is comfortable in their presence, and they are comfortable in his.  Lalezari has the owner's manual clutched between his hands.  He reads it night and day because he possesses integrity.

"In a remarkable medical breakthrough, an 18-month-old British toddler, Opal Sandy, heard sound for the first time in her life. Born with auditory neuropathy—a condition that disrupts nerve impulses from the inner ear to the brain—Opal had been unable to hear anything since birth. However, a clinical trial led by the **University of Cambridge** and involving a pioneering gene therapy treatment, **DB-OTO**, has changed her life and opened new possibilities for treating deafness. [Read more](https://www.reviewspace.info/breakthrough-gene-therapy-restores-hearing-in-toddler-a-new-era-for-treating-deafness)

"My dog was recently Dx with kidney disease after increasing thirst/urination and then bedwetting over the last few months. It look longer than I would have liked to get the diagnosis due to various issues with lost samples/missing lab results. Anyway, I've included the most recent test results below.

The vet has advised putting her on a renal diet, so I'm currently trialing a bunch of them (hills k/d, royal canin, purina etc.) to see what she finds most palatable. I've stopped giving her animal products as snacks/treats (so no meat, no fish, no liver treats, no bull pizzles or antlers etc. etc. and, to her chagrin, no cheese) and also anything with a lot of sodium (crisps/chips/salted popcorn) (which I was only doing rarely anyway, like if a crisp fell on the floor or something). Luckily she's almost as happy with a carrot...

Questions:
> * How ill is she? The vet didn't mention a ""stage"" or anything like that but google suggests there are indeed stages...
> * Should I expect her symptoms to improve on the new diet, or just not worsen?
> * What can I expect in terms of prognosis, quality of life?
> * Should I be encouraging her to drink as much as possible and making her meals as soupy/wet as possible?
> * Am I doing enough to help her by changing to a medicated dog food, cutting out the cheese/meat in favour of carrots?
> * Is there anything else I should be doing?
> * Should I be asking the vet to retest her urine/blood monthly? Or how often? (We're at the vet monthly anyway for her Librela jabs)

"tw: infertility; pregnancy loss; sexual assault; ptsd.

sorry about the length but I really needed to let this out. I haven't been able to really say the whole story like this. I'm stuck awake anyway because I accidentally took the daytime medication dose instead of my sleep medication so I thought I'd try.

What happened to me is so insane that I still don't really understand it. I can't believe it, or maybe I'm just still in shock. I keep going over and over it.

I have pretty severe ADHD as well as non-verbal learning disorder. I've never been in a real ""adult"" romantic relationship before, and once I hit 29 I started thinking seriously about trying to have a child by myself. I'd done a lot of work on myself since college, and I was finally in a place where I thought I would just about be able to afford it with some (offered) family help with childcare, etc. I had no reason to believe I'd be infertile, but the first IUI didn't work and a blockage was discovered in my right fallopian tube. The fertility doctor refused to try another IUI unless I had that tube removed, so in June of 2022 that surgery took place.

Unfortunately, it was discovered during the surgery that both of my tubes were blocked, so both of them were removed, which I was informed of directly upon waking up from surgery. While I afforded nearly all of the IUI by myself, there was no way I could afford IVF. I agonized for months, all my life I had been terrified of infertility and I had hoped by starting earlier than most I could have avoided it. Finally left my job. I didn't even want to leave my job, it had given me a ton of confidence when I was able to thrive there (for the most part). I was proud of myself for leaving at the time, since I'm generally quite passive and nervous about that level of risk with anything to do with money.

The new job was with a call center for a financial company. It was absolute havok on my anxiety but I held out as long as I could. I made it from November 2022 to August 11th, 2023. In July, I did the egg retrieval,  meaning I was on some level of fertility medication from the end of May to the end of August. We got 14 eggs, and 9 embryos. My parents even paid for chromosomal testing, so I ended up with 7 genetically normal 5-day blastocysts, 4 boys and 3 girls. The doctor told me flat-out, ""you will never have to have another egg retrieval."" It was literally the first uplifting news, the first time anything with right at all, since I started trying to have a child at all.

However, I was secretly mentally cratering. My depression from the continued obstacles in my fertility ""journey"" (lmao what the fuck ever) mixed with my anxiety from work plus the fertility hormone cocktail meant I called out sick pretty much as often as I could and even when I couldn't. I was shaking like a leaf the whole time I had a call come in. I thought the abilitty to work from home would make up for the shitty job but it absolutely DID NOT and in fact made it worse. I tried so hard to just stick it out, I tried to get through with edibles to calm me down, I had my aniexty medication dosage increased (after my meds had been stable for years which was huge for me). None of it worked, and in the middle of Jine, I just started calling in sick every single day. I was in physical pain from the anxiety and the depression was keeping me bedridden so much that  in February I hurt my back enough that I needed physical therapy. But I was so fixated on just keeping their excellent insurance that I just kept silent to anyone who could have helped me and pretended everything was fine so I could go through this without anyone talking me down.

Somehow through a combination of doctor's notes about my back and the company being very heavily automated I still hadn't been fired by the company. I went further, the embryo transfer was done on August 2nd of '23, and I still don't know why I did this except I was stuck on the idea that if I had the transfer done before they fired me, it would still be covered under insurance. Like I could just sneak a baby through with me like an office stapler.

Even the embryo transfer felt ominous. I had told the clinic that I didn't want to choose the biological sex, because having a choice at all made me uncomfortable (it felt so strange that I had to consciously choose a RACE for the baby, I was like.....I guess white?). I told them just to use the best quality one they had. But then on the morning of the transfer, I got a call from the clinic that the first embryo died during the unfreezing process. That's a  somewhat rare thing to happen, but they said they would just unfreeze the next best one.

The embryo was biologically female. ""I wanted a girl!"" came out of my mouth immediately. I asked, and the embryo that died was a boy. I felt like this girl was meant to be a little bit, it felt so right to have her there. I had slight pregnancy symptoms pretty early (nausea out of nowhere), and I just felt a hundred percent sure that it had worked. I was right. On August 9th I was confirmed to be pregnant. On August 11th I finally lost my job.

Finanacially this is absolutely the worst possible option. I still don't know why I did it, but it felt so right and I felt so connected to the world for the first time in months. I knew how bad this was, I knew I'd been ignoring my mental health and it was out of control, I knew it was wayyy too early to think about having a child, but I just didn't care in the face of that good feeling, I'd never experienced anything like it before. I just started applying to jobs and thinking about sacrifices I could make to get us through this.

On August 29th, I went to the clinic for what was supposed to be my final ultrasound. I threw up for the very first time on the way out the door, and honestly was grateful for it. The ultrasound tech was very quiet, and spoke somewhat limited English. She spent a long time looking, and apologizing for not finding it, then saying she was going to get the doctor. I thought maybe she just needed some help finding it, but a large part of me knew, even then.

The pregnancy wasn't there, because it was in the stump of the right fallopian tube that had caused trouble in the first place. I had a tubal pregnancy *with no fallopian tubes*. The ooctor said ""this shouldn't have happened"" like six times and actually told me I should think about legal action. That ended up not going anywhere, no law firms seemed interested in taking my case.

I needed emergency surgery, and I had it at about 12 hours later on August 30th. I was absolutely stunned and felt just....deeply main-character-but-in-a-mean-book. I couldn't get over this weird bad luck, I'd prepared myself for the IVF not working, or for a miscarriage, but certainly not the one thing that had supposedly been prevented. I felt like it was karma for me being so stupid. I still feel like that. I put everything I had into that one basket, retirement savings and credit included.

I spent about 3 weeks in mourning, mostly in bed, getting very high on edibles almost the entire time. I was just getting out of the deepest depression and had actually just arranged for a job interview when my apartment was broken into. At about four am on September 23rd, I was lying in bed watching youtube videos when a stranger got into my bed with me. I tried to fight him, but he had a gone and pistol whipped me about 5-6 times, opening up a very long gash in my head.  He proceeded to rape me several times while I was heavily bleeding. He would not leave afterward, and I kept looking at the gun while sitting on the edge of my bed. I finally told him I was going to the hospital, put on a shirt, slipped on some flipflops & left.

I drove myself to the hospital, they sent the police who found him still in my apartment, literally red-handed.  He was still in my bed. I mostly just remember being very concerned for my cats and desperately wanting to rinse the blood out of my hair and off of my face. My mom and I had to wait for a few hours after being discharged, and we went to Target to get me some clothes & then to Olive Garden because I asked for it for some reason. It was the most surreal feeling, I kept thinking that I thought the worst thing in my life had already happened to me.

Since then I've been a wreck. I have full blown PTSD, I'm basically a recluse now. I am on edibles almost every day, my ADHD medication doesn't work anymore, and I am now living in my parents' unfinished basement with my cats. Personal hygeine is even worse and I'm barely able to keep myself sort of fed on something. I actually went to a job interview on September 29th, less than a week later, with two black eyes and a bandaged forehead. And I got the job! It must have been a pity invite. Almost immediately the PTSD was too much for me to be in an office environment, and I lost that job too. I have intense panic whenever I need to make any decisions because I'm convinced they're all wrong, I'm also convinced that my mental health will never be good enough to try to have kids ever again, and last month I got a letter letting me know that my payment is due for storage for my five remaining embryos (which I anticipated and was expecting, but the letter also announced that the price went up over 200% this year, lmao). The man who asssaulted me was found incompetant to stand trial last week.

And now it's fucking mother's day weekend."

Migraine sufferers drop prescription drugs at record pace and switch to cannabis for headache pain!

Ask anyone who’s ever suffered from chronic migraines, and they can tell you that these headaches can rob you of quality of life. Migraines are by no means just any type of headache: they can result in symptoms such as irritability, nausea, and fatigue on top of the migraine pain. These symptoms, in turn, can be triggered by simple things such as lights, movements, and sound.

While some individuals experience acute migraines, there are many who suffer from chronic or long-lasting migraine episodes. These can last for several hours, making it impossible to continue with work and play. Migraines are also extremely common, affecting some 15% of the worldwide population.

Since there are so many different factors that can cause migraines, it can be difficult to treat. There are many things that can cause migraines, such as hormonal fluctuations (for women), alcohol use, lack of sleep, side effect of medications, and even genetics. There are a range of specialized pharmaceutical medications that have been developed to treat migraines, such as beta blockers and triptans such as eletriptan, sumatriptan, triptan, rizatriptan, and many more.

However, these migraine medications also may come with side effects. Triptans, in particular, are commonly associated with limb heaviness, fatigue, tightness in the jaw, chest, or throat, and myalgias.



That said, cannabis has been shown to be as effective as prescription medications without the side effects, or are even more effective!

The good news is that cannabis has been shown to be extremely beneficial for migraine sufferers. The human body has several endocannabinoid receptors, many of which are concentrated in the central nervous system as well as the brain. When you have a migraine and medicate with cannabis, the cannabinoids bind with these receptors to provide relief.

There are several studies that back up these claims, too.

In March 2024, the results of [a study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38455123/) conducted by researchers from Yale School of Medicine was published. The investigators polled feedback from 1,373 patients at a tertiary headache clinic, with less than a third of them reporting that they are current cannabis users.

For the cannabis consumers, a majority said that it either improved symptoms or at least reduced the frequency of migraines. Meanwhile, 63% of respondents said that cannabis consumption also helped them decrease or completely eliminate their prescription medications for migraines. “This is the largest study to date to document cannabis product usage patterns and perceived benefits for migraine management in a clinical headache patient sample” concluded the study authors. “A majority of patients surveyed reported using cannabis products for migraine management and cited perceived improvements in migraine characteristics, clinical features, and associated risk factors” they added.

# Other Studies Back Up Cannabis’ Safety And Efficacy For Migraines

Researchers from the University of California at San Diego [published results of a clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10889030/) last February 2024. The trials involved analyzing the safety and efficacy of herbal cannabis for 92 patients who suffered from persistent migraines. The cannabis flower used for the trial contained both CBD and THC.

The patients were randomly given vaporized cannabis in various ratios, containing a range of THC and CBD, as well as placebo after they experienced migraines. They researchers found that out of the 4 cannabis chemotypes, the vaporized cannabis with both THC and CBD were the most effective.

“Vaporized 6% THC + 11% CBD cannabis flower was superior to placebo for pain relief, pain freedom, and MBS \[most bothersome symptom\] freedom at 2 hours as well as 24-hour sustained pain freedom and sustained MBS freedom and 48-hour sustained MBS freedom” said the authors. In addition, they found that the THC/CBD flower was more effective than placebo when it came to providing relief from photophobia, or light sensitivity, as well as sound sensitivity caused by migraines.

It's also good to note that the participants did not report any adverse side effects during the trial. “Future research should include multicenter studies and long-term studies of benefits and risks with repeated use” concluded the investigators.

There are also studies that validate the safety of cannabis in treating migraines. For one, let’s take a review conducted by investigators at the California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences and Psychology. The investigators analyzed 9 recent studies which assessed more than 5,600 subjects.

“All the studies showed encouraging findings on the therapeutic effects of medicinal marijuana in migraine treatment. Additionally, medical marijuana is well-tolerated with fewer side effects and is safe to use in migraine patients” the authors reported.

“The studies demonstrated that medical marijuana has a significant clinical response by reducing the length and frequency of migraines. No severe adverse effects were noted. Due to its effectiveness and convenience, medical marijuana therapy may be helpful for patients suffering from migraines” they concluded.

# Conclusion

Based on research, cannabis flower and other products that contain both THC and CBD are the most effective. However, cannabis isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, and there is no standardized dosage recommendation for migraine patients just yet.

You may have to experiment with various products and doses to find one that works well for you. Be open and you might just find the perfect cannabis product for your medical needs.

Non-fiction and autobiographical, this fascinating book details some of the court trials, both criminal and civil, at which the eminent clinical and research neurologist Dr Klawans was called as an expert medical witness.  It has a flavour of Oliver Sacks and House, M.D with a dash of Erin Brokovich and Ally McBeal - in that many of the cases involve detailed neurological investigation to find the mysterious cause of severe symptoms or to explain bizarre violent crimes or to get redress for innocents injured by corporate negligence. It has great science writing, the satisfaction of mysteries being methodically resolved as well as high court-room tensions and drama.

Beautifully written, concise and really holds the reader's attention. The cases described are fascinating - ranging from really curious, odd to the bizarre and dangerously, violently criminal and often raise really profoundly thought provoking questions of medical and legal morality.  One example is that of a sleep-walker who apparently murders and maims multiple victims in a fit of rage - was he really sleep-walking and is he responsible for the carnage?

Highly recommended for fans of science writing and particularly medical/ neurological writing for non-experts in those fields, and also those who enjoy ""investigative"" science mystery and real court / trial cases. Dr Klawans has written several other books that focus on real perplexing medical cases from his career and famous people  or events in history where neurological disease was key."


"# Amino Asylum Tamoxifen

**What is Amino Asylum Tamoxifen?**

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has garnered significant attention in both research and clinical practice for its role in the management of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Originally developed as a contraceptive, tamoxifen's unique properties have led to its widespread use in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer, as well as exploration in other therapeutic areas.

**Key Features and Benefits:**

1. **Breast Cancer Treatment**: Tamoxifen is a cornerstone therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, which accounts for the majority of breast cancer cases. By selectively blocking estrogen receptors in breast tissue, it inhibits estrogen-driven tumor growth and reduces the risk of cancer recurrence following surgery or chemotherapy.
2. **Adjuvant Therapy**: Tamoxifen is commonly used as adjuvant therapy in both pre- and post-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. It helps reduce the risk of cancer recurrence, prolongs disease-free survival, and improves overall survival rates when used as part of a comprehensive treatment regimen.
3. **Chemoprevention**: In addition to its therapeutic role, tamoxifen has shown efficacy in breast cancer prevention among high-risk individuals, such as those with a strong family history of the disease or prior breast abnormalities. Long-term use of tamoxifen can significantly reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
4. **Bone Health**: Tamoxifen exhibits estrogen-like effects on bone tissue, contributing to the maintenance of bone density and reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures, particularly in post-menopausal women. This beneficial effect on bone health is an important consideration in the management of breast cancer survivors.
5. **Endometrial Cancer Risk**: While tamoxifen offers significant benefits in breast cancer treatment and prevention, it is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, particularly in post-menopausal women. Regular gynecological monitoring is essential to detect and manage potential endometrial abnormalities promptly.
6. **Estrogen Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer**: Tamoxifen is also used in the management of advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is estrogen receptor-positive. It can help slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and improve quality of life in this patient population, often in combination with other therapies.
7. **Tamoxifen Resistance**: Despite its effectiveness, some breast cancers may develop resistance to tamoxifen over time, limiting its therapeutic efficacy. Ongoing research aims to identify biomarkers of tamoxifen resistance and develop strategies to overcome this challenge, such as combination therapies or alternative SERMs.
8. **Potential Applications in Other Cancers**: Beyond breast cancer, tamoxifen's anti-estrogenic properties have prompted investigation into its potential efficacy in other hormone-sensitive cancers, such as endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its role in these malignancies.

In summary, tamoxifen represents a pivotal therapy in the management of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, offering both treatment and prevention benefits. Its versatility, efficacy, and relatively favorable safety profile have established it as a cornerstone of breast cancer care and continue to drive research into its potential applications in other cancer types.

"Hi all,

I'm curious what people might think about developing empirical approaches from current unsupported approaches. 

Internal family systems is especially common in my area, and therapists are constantly talking about it. It makes me wonder if there are indeed might be helpful elements to the method.

In [Pseudoscience in Therapy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/pseudoscience-in-therapy/dissociation/74B03C1DBDD3F3413DC425BC586BCD35) the authors talk briefly about IFS as an unsupported treatment method for dissociation, but some new data has arrived claiming IFS is based on existing and well-supported theory of treatment (Brenner et al., 2023 - this study is not my favorite TBH, too much opinion), and even a pilot study which shows significant reduction in PTSD symptomology (Hodgdon et al., 2022; this one is pretty comprehensive and solid looking to me).

In the chapter from Pseudoscience in therapy by Lynn et al., it appears that there has been one case of an individual with very poor outcomes who was treated at an eating disorder clinic which uses IFS. However, I don't think this in itself is evidence that IFS cannot be a valuable treatment, and I wonder if it represents a misunderstanding of the treatment as performed by that therapist (this client was labeled with 20 separate identities as a part of DID dx). To me, the recognition of internal narratives which promote avoidance and pliance are well supported in the CBT literature and serve as common treatment targets.

The process of developing an EBP from the APA includes the following steps: Clinical observation, qualitative data, systematic case studies, single-case experimental designs, public health/ethnographic research, process-outcome studies (mechanism of change), studies of interventions in their environment, RCT's, meta-analysis ([APA, 2006](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/evidence-based-statement.pdf)). 

I wonder -- what would need to occur further to develop an EBP from IFS? What would you want to see in a randomized trial for IFS? Which one of those steps is most interesting to you and how would you design a study around the missing links/most unsupported elements of IFS? "

>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) will launch clinical trials to investigate potential treatments for long-term symptoms after COVID-19 infection, including sleep disturbances, exercise intolerance and the worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). The mid-stage trials, part of NIH’s Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, will join six other RECOVER studies currently enrolling participants across the United States testing treatments to address viral persistence, neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction (like brain fog) and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The new trials will enroll approximately 1,660 people across 50 study sites to investigate potential treatments for some of the most frequent and burdensome symptoms reported by people suffering from long COVID.

>RECOVER-SLEEP clinical trials will include (a) a trial to test two drugs (modafinil and solriamfetol) approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat people who have problems staying awake during the day, known as hypersomnia, and (b) a trial to test potential treatments for complex sleep disturbances due to long COVID, including melatonin, an over-the-counter supplement commonly used to treat people with sleep disorders and general insomnia; and light therapy, which is used to help people reset their sleep cycles.

>RECOVER-ENERGIZE clinical trial will include (a) a trial that will test a program that combines exercise training, strength and flexibility training,  education, and social support, collectively known as personalized cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, and (b) a trial to test a program known as structured pacing, which is designed to help participants with PEM identify, control, and minimize symptoms that developed after having COVID-19 by regulating or pacing their daily activities. Currently, structured pacing is the only intervention used to treat PEM. 

>Diversity among trial participants is a high priority for the RECOVER Initiative. To support diverse and inclusive representation, study sites are chosen based on geographic location, their connection to communities, and track record for enrolling diverse research participants. Teams at the selected study sites will recruit participants from their health systems and surrounding communities.

People 18 years of age and older who are interested in learning more about these trials can visit trials.RECOVERCovid.org or ClinicalTrials.gov and search identifiers NCT06404047, NCT06404060, NCT06404073, NCT06404086, NCT06404099, NCT06404112."
"# Vitamin A

Vitamin A is a crucial nutrient for skin health, and its deficiency has been linked to acne. A recent study published in the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology found that oral vitamin A supplementation may be a possible substitute for isotretinoin in the management of acne \[1\].

# Vitamin D

Several studies have investigated the relationship between vitamin D levels and acne. A case-control study combined with a randomized controlled trial found that patients with acne had significantly lower levels of vitamin D compared to those without acne \[2\]. Another study found that active vitamin D administration improved the clinical outcomes of acne vulgaris \[3\]. Additionally, a meta-analysis and systematic review found that serum and supplemental vitamin D levels were associated with insulin resistance in populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus \[4\].

# Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)

Pantothenic acid, also known as vitamin B5, has been studied for its potential role in acne management. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that a novel pantothenic acid-based dietary supplement improved mild to moderate facial acne \[5\]. Another study demonstrated the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of a pantothenic acid-based dietary supplement in subjects with mild to moderate facial acne blemishes \[6\]. Dr. Jeffrey Dach, MD, has also written about the use of pantothenic acid for acne treatment \[7\]. Furthermore, a paper published in the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine discussed how pantothenic acid may help in the treatment of both acne vulgaris and obesity \[8\].

# Other Nutrients

Several other nutrients have been studied for their potential role in acne management, including:

* Vitamin B12
* Vitamin E \[9\]
* Omega-3 fatty acids \[10, 11\]
* Zinc \[12, 13\]
* Selenium \[14, 9\]
* Chromium \[15\]
* Magnesium \[16\]

A study by Shalita et al. also investigated the use of a prescription dietary supplement containing B vitamins and zinc in the management of inflammatory acne \[17\].

# Conclusion

The evidence presented in this blog post suggests that nutrient deficiencies may play a significant role in the development and management of acne. While more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between nutrients and acne, the studies discussed here provide a strong foundation for further investigation. If you are struggling with acne, it may be worth discussing nutrient supplementation with your healthcare provider as part of a comprehensive acne management plan.

"I absolutely love my clinic and my coworkers and managers but we have been very badly effected by a lack of staff and I feel guilty about how much these parents are paying not knowing how little programs are getting run during parts of the day. Some days the integrated preschool just needs so much help that rbts have to step in so much that a client may have less than 10 programs ran in a roughly 3 hour session. Some of the integrated kids have more behaviors and need more help than the clients do so they can be very demanding attention wise at times. I try and run as many programs as I can in the afternoon after I get a client that’s affected by an understaffed or chaotic preschool day but feel bad throwing so many programs at a kid in a short span. Some kids just can’t handle that many programs in a short span especially after a whole morning of not doing much and having minimal demands placed. I also feel like I should tell the parents they’re kids didn’t do many programs all morning but I know I’d probably get in trouble for that so I won’t which is just making me feel even more guilty. I know I wouldn’t want to pay that much money knowing that my kid wasn’t running programs for hours of the day because other kids needed help. What can I do to get trial counts up when the other rbts just aren’t running programs because they’re too busy helping with other kids? I just don’t know what to do in my situation it feels like all I can do is push my kids harder to pick up the slack which hurts my pairing with the kids because I become the hard teacher that makes them do more work than they’re other therapists and that doesn’t let them play as much.

##anti-corruption: former officials are accused of embezzling French aid and giving away territories to friends for pennies 

**REPORT:** Fifteen years ago Yerevan's Vardavar Park [aka Lyon Park] was given to the associates of ex-regime MP Mher Sedrakyan at a price 20x below the market value, for 99 years. It was done with the help of MP Sedrakyan's relative Armen Harutyunyan, who served as the head of Yerevan's Erebuni district in 2009-2017; he is a defendant. The territory was allegedly given without an auction.

**AUTHORITIES:** In 2008, Yerevan municipality and the French city of Lyon signed a cooperation agreement. The French colleagues gave €95,000 to renovate the Vardavar Park. The city organized a tender to choose a company for the park's renovation. The defendant and a construction company signed an agreement. The company was given ֏16 million to launch the renovation. The renovation was underway. However, in the midst of the process, the defendant decided to lease out the park to an associate of MP Mher Sedrakyan for a period of 99 years, under the made-up pretense that the community didn't have funds to renovate it.

Moreover, under the land code, it was prohibited to sell or lease out that territory. The lease was signed without an auction. The park was given away for only ֏615,000/year ($1,500/yr), when the real value was ֏12.5 million/yr.

As for the remaining portion of the €95,000 French aid, it is unclear where that money went because Yerevan municipality did not preserve the documents. 

The same defendant was also a subject in a separate asset forfeiture case. He agreed to surrender assets including a house, a car, and ֏29 million. //

##PM Pashinyan discussed the removal of Russian border and military posts during the Moscow trip 

The Russian posts deployed during and after the 2020 war on the AM-AZ border will be removed. They were installed at the request of Armenia but since the AM-AZ border is more stable now and there is a delimitation process, they are no longer needed.

Russian agents will also leave Yerevan's international airport [by August, as reported earlier]. The removal was confirmed ""at the highest level"" during the [Pashinyan-Putin meeting on Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1cnk0j0/france_us_welcome_tavush_border_delimitation/), said a ranking member of Armenia's ruling party QP. 

Armenia did not request for the removal of the main Russian posts located on the borders with Turkey and Iran, which were deployed shortly after Armenia's independence from the USSR.

##the former regime concludes the Tavush-Yerevan march with an anti-Pashinyan rally in Yerevan's main square: VIDEO 

The opposition churchman Bagrat Galstanyan, the co-organizer of the rally, said he is willing to meet and discuss the terms for Pashinyan's resignation. He gave Pashinyan 1 hour to resign. ""You no longer have any form of power in Armenia. With your resignation, you will return the [victory] to the Armenian people.""

Galstanyan listed the goal: 

(1) Parliament must hold a vote of no confidence to oust Pashinyan. He met several opposition MPs to organize the process. ""We will find a path.""

(2) They will hold 2021-2022 style acts of disobedience and road closures.

(3) Galstanyan wants these protests to last 7-10 days so he urged the attendees, who looked largely unenthusiastic with only a few hundred responding to Bagrat's chants, not to lose interest and to show up tomorrow as well. There were ~31,700 people by some estimates. In 2021-2022 there were around 35,000 rallygoers if we don't count Robert Kocharyan's final rally that was held in the Republic Square days before the 2021 election day. 

(4) Galstanyan plans to spend the night in Republic Square and meet the protesters tomorrow morning.

Notable parties and figures who joined or endorsed the ARF/Church rally: ARF's local and international structures, Serj's HHK leadership and its ""youth wing"", Kocharyan's ""Armenia"" faction MPs, the Union of Armenians in Russia led by pro-Kremlin Ara Abrahamyan, Russian-Armenian billionaire Ruben Vardanyan's Aprelu Yerkir party, the Hayaqve, Kocharyan's friend Vitaliy Balasanyan and other politicians from Nagorno-Karabakh, ex-Ombudsman Arman Tatoyan who recently participated in a forum organized by the ex-regime, an aspiring revolutionary Vazgen Manukyan, Paruyr Hayrikyan, the leadership of radical group BEVER, several MPs representing the pro-Russian opposition factions in the parliament, Mihran Poghosyan (suspected of narcotrafficking, hiding in Russia), Serj's son, Naira Zohrabyan, singers Shprot, Andre, Sofi Mkheyan, Mger Armenia, and others. 

A drunk driver of a [truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGIQ4Injipg) was arrested after attempting to drive through the square full of people. He drove towards the police officers and over the sidewalks before reaching the square. No reports of injury. 

Authorities launched a criminal investigation after the protesters allegedly destroyed a journalist's camera.

The newspaper owned by PM Pashinyan's family writes that the ruling party knew in advance about Bagrat's intentions [until the last moment the organizers were claiming the march wasn't about ousting Pashinyan]. The newspaper writes that the police has been instructed to give a ""firm response"" if there are riots. The protest is in front of the government building. There were no reports of riots or clashes with the police. The archbishop urged the participants not to engage in violence. 

The crowd began to leave in the late evening. Some of them expressed disappointment about the rally launching 2 hours late and about a lack of a specific plan by the organizers. They were asked to ""paralyze the country"" starting tomorrow at 10 am.

In the meantime, the opposition parties will try to organize a vote of no confidence to oust Pashinyan. They need 36 votes to advance it. They currently have 35 members but one independent MP used to be their member so they might have the number. Once the motion advances, the parliament holds a vote within 2-3 days. The PM is ousted if at least 54 of the 107 MPs vote in favor.  

##... the anti-former regime figures respond to the rally 

**ARMAN BABAJANYAN:** It is necessary to carry out internal reforms in the Church to allow it to become more flexible, to allow it to function without being an attachment of the oligarchy, so it can function as an independent structure. This process has one goal: to prevent the peaceful delimitation of borders and cause a war. War is their only option for returning to power. They will feel relieved, hidden behind the archbishops, when the bombs begin to fall on Yerevan. //

A video was circulated about protesters discussing the possibility of bringing weapons to the rally. Authorities arrested two individuals in the video.

**DANIEL IOANNESIAN:** The police must ensure that the protest is peaceful and there are no people with weapons. The use of force against peaceful protesters is illegal, but it is justified against violent ones. 

**RULING PARTY SECRETARY:** An agreement was reached in Moscow to withdraw Russian border guards from Yerevan's Zvartnots Airport. I hope this news won't sadden the organizers of the rally too much. 

**RULING MP ALEXANYAN:** The former regime is just rotating the leaders of its movement. In 2022 the same Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan was a guest speaker during Kocharyan's ""Zartnir Lao"" protests. Today he is the face. They just rotate the frontman. 

**RULING MP TOROSYAN:** We thank Archbishop Bagrat for joining our anti-smoking campaign by urging his followers in Republic Square not to smoke. *[does Torosyan win the prize for the most civil response?]*

##non-parliamentary pro-West forces and the ruling party took part in an event dedicated to AM-EU relations and CEPA 

**REPORTER:** Are you satisfied with the government's policies and do you believe they are taking us to Euro-integration? 

**ARAM SARGSYAN (ex-PM):** Yes, Armenia is headed to Euro-integration. The government is doing it slowly out of caution because of regional issues. I'm a supporter of a faster integration because that would improve our safety, not harm it. 

**REPORTER:** Pashinyan and Putin discussed the withdrawal of Russian troops from the AM-AZ border. Why now?

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** It's within the framework of taking Armenia to the EU. I congratulate the Armenian public on the gradual withdrawal of Russia from our region after hundreds of years. Russia will eventually withdraw fully because they are not USSR and they don't have the power to forcefully stay. Russia must stick to its own business and attempt to become a European state itself. That will help them develop but that's up to the Russian people to decide. We welcome the withdrawal of foreign forces from the AM-AZ border. I hope they will leave the AM-IR border soon, and later from the AM-TR border. *[that order is oddly specific and interesting]*

**REPORTER:** What's your opinion on the opposition rally and demands for Pashinyan's resignation? 

**ARAM SARGSYAN:** This process has a participant located outside Armenia. In Armenia, Pashinyan's disapproval rating is about 20% lower than Russia's, which is why Russia wanted to find a figure to rally the anti-Pashinyan population without triggering an association with Russia. Sadly they found that figure in the church. People [oppsoiton politicians] who never believed in God and never valued the church are exploiting the church today. 

Robert Kocharyan first revealed the idea of using the church during the 2022 protests. But Russia has miscalculated because the same ex-regime politicians will show up to Archbishop's rallies and expose Russia's involvement. 

Sasna Tsrer (Bever) has joined the protests. Will they stand on that stage and declare that Russia is an axis of evil? Figures from Bright Armenia [Edmon Marutyan's party] have also joined; will they stand on that stage and declare that Armenia must adopt a European model? The forces that gathered there do not have a common agenda for Armenia's future. If they want ""answers"" from the government about the Tavush delimitation, then those answers have been given to them on numerous occasions. This is not about Tavush. This is about geopolitics and control over a Meghri corridor.

"I don't even know what to say. I've been on 6 antidepressants, they told me I don't communicate well enough to be able to do therapy. My next appointment is tomorrow but I read my notes from my last review and it essentially says they're planning on discharging me because I haven't gotten any better. In what world is this right? Surely patients who aren't getting better are the ones that need help the most? They haven't even exercised all their options, there are classes of antidepressant I haven't been put on yet, and the ones they have tried they haven't given me long enough prescriptions for. Some of them have been for 1 week, 2 weeks, I haven't been on any longer than a month. It's like they haven't even tried but they're blaming me for not improving. I truly want to end my life now, this was my only hope and if they discharge me, I have no other services to get help from. The IAPT said my case was too complex for them to handle.

This is what the CMHT wrote in my last review:

> We felt the best way forward at the moment was for her to take the Duloxetine as originally planned. If this was effective then we could move on to the next stage. If this is ineffective then we are limited in our options as to what can be tolerated and it may be that we do not consider medication as a viable option. We do not feel that it will be beneficial to continue to offer various types of medications as this clearly reduces her overall sense of hope.

> We agreed that [care coordinator] would be in contact with her next week to look at next steps and that we will review things again once we are able to see how the Duloxetine has gone. [My name] gives a sense of being disappointed by this however this has always been her presentation and we feel that the best way forward at this moment in time is to make small clinically informed decisions to see if she is willing to work with us on these. This is felt to be within her best interests otherwise we would be unable to move forward and we will struggle to develop any form of meaningful engagement.

> Should we not be able to do this following a further trial of medication and various suggestions about how she can develop psychological engagement, it may be that we consider that Monntana has a time away from services to collect her thoughts and to return when she feels more able to express herself. This obviously carries an element of risk in that she may feel rejected by this approach however when she attends and we are unable to meet her needs this may be a more risk laden approach as this can decrease her hope. 

I'm being left to fend for myself. I don't understand how their main concern could be decreasing my hope and yet they fail to see how discharging me leaves me with absolutely no hope at all.

"Hello! I'll be in my last year of undergrad this fall and spring (my major is molecular biosciences & biotech), and I'll be working on my master's as well (my school does accelerated master's programs, mine will be in biology). I think I've made the decision to not pursue a PhD. I was wondering based on the interests of mine from the title if I'd be able to get a job with a BS and MS. I'll be looking for jobs too and the requirements but I wanted to know people's degrees and if they're in job positions from the title above (or anything similar)! Thanks!

Edit: For a little bit of background, my undergrad major is very genetics- based. I've also been working on certificates in evolutionary medicine and computational life sciences (this is where the coding comes in place). I've worked in a lab that focuses on wastewater-based epidemiology and uses bioinformatic methods. My master's will be a bit in genetics too, working with phenotype/genotype mutations, CRISPR Cas-9, and machine learning for my thesis."
"Hi! I read a book recently about a couple in NYC who are separated or divorced. Was fun and fast in the same way as Fleishman is in trouble. In this novel, the husband loses his medical license because he was signing patients up for clinical trials without their notice. Does anyone know???"
"Quick info regarding my gastritis:

I was diagnosed with H. Pylori in 2023 and got stomach ulcers. Got on triple therapy antibiotics and PPI (Now i'm H. pylori negative). After three months I was healed (so i thought), so I went back to my old habits such as eating junk food, long sitting on computer, and pretty much everything I was not suppose to do or eat for GERD diet. The flare up came back after two weeks as i didn't let it heal properly and now it turned into chronic stomach gastritis (stomach lining inflamation), endoscopy confirmed it.

It's been about a year now living with gastritis and constantly researching trying to figure out how to heal gastritis.

I was talking with OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.0 trying to educate myself on how the body works and eventually asked this question:

Me:

>if the first line of treatment does not work for healing stomach gastritis, what are other approaches? even approaches that may not be currently FDA approved but  evidence for animal testing like rats, mice, etc.. proven to work?

>note, the first line of treatment includes, triple therapy antibiotics to eradicate bacterias. h2 blockers, ppi. Symptoms include history of h pylori but h pylori is killed but the damage remains of ulcers later turned into gastritis.

ChatGPT's response (**see #4 about stem cell therapy**):

>**1. Probiotics**: Although commonly used and available over the counter, the use of probiotics for gastritis is still under research. Probiotics can help restore the balance of good bacteria in the stomach, which might be disrupted after long courses of antibiotics.

>**2. Dietary Changes**: Adjusting the diet to eliminate or reduce foods that irritate the stomach lining can help manage symptoms. This is not a cure, but it can significantly alleviate discomfort and promote healing.

>**3. Experimental Therapies**: There are ongoing studies into various new drugs and biological therapies that aim to more effectively target the inflammatory processes involved in gastritis. These are not widely available and would typically be accessed through clinical trials.

>**4. Stem Cell Therapy**: Some very early stage research has looked at the potential of stem cells to heal damaged gastric tissues in animal models. This is far from being an approved treatment but is an area of interest for future therapies.

Me:

>what is stem cell therapy? how can it be used for gastritis?

ChatGPT's response:

>Stem cell therapy involves using stem cells, which are special cells that have the ability to develop into many different types of cells in the body. This therapy is based on the idea that stem cells can be used to repair or replace damaged tissue. Here’s how it works and how it might be applied to conditions like gastritis:

>How Stem Cell Therapy Works:

>**1. Source**: Stem cells can be sourced from various parts of the body, including bone marrow, fat tissue, or even blood. There are also pluripotent stem cells, which can be engineered in the lab to become any type of cell needed.

>**2. Preparation**: Once collected, these stem cells are prepared and possibly manipulated in a lab to enhance their therapeutic potential.

>**3. Administration**: The prepared stem cells are then reintroduced into the patient’s body, targeting the area where repair or regeneration is needed.

>

>Potential Use for Gastritis:

>In the context of gastritis, the chronic inflammation damages the stomach lining, leading to ulcers and other painful symptoms. Here’s how stem cell therapy could potentially help:

>**1. Regeneration**: Stem cells could be directed to the damaged areas of the stomach lining to promote regeneration of the tissue, effectively repairing the damage caused by gastritis.

>**2. Anti-inflammatory Properties**: Some studies suggest that stem cells can modulate the immune system and reduce inflammation, which would be beneficial in reducing the symptoms of gastritis.

>**3. Restoration of Function**: By regenerating healthy tissue, stem cell therapy could help restore normal function to the stomach lining, potentially reversing the effects of chronic gastritis.

>Research and Limitations

>While the potential is significant, stem cell therapy for gastritis is still in the early stages of research, primarily at the preclinical level with animal studies. The challenges include ensuring the safety of the therapy, such as preventing the stem cells from differentiating into unwanted tissue types or causing immune reactions.

>Given these factors, stem cell therapy for gastritis isn't currently available as a standard treatment and would typically be accessed through clinical trials. Further research and development are needed to determine its efficacy and safety for regular clinical use.

TL;DR

Got treated for H. Pylori and ulcers, got better, then slipped back into old habits, didn't let it heal properly and ended up with chronic gastritis. Been chatting with ChatGPT4 about beyond-the-basics treatments. Found out about stem cell therapy.

What are y'all thoughts on stem cell therapy for potentially healing stomach gastritis if caused by h. pylori?

"***Performance Sets New Record for First Quarter Revenue***

**ANN ARBOR, MI / ACCESSWIRE / May 9, 2024** **/** Zomedica Corp. (NYSE American:ZOM) (""Zomedica"" or the ""Company""), a veterinary health company offering point-of-care diagnostic and therapeutic products for equine and companion animals, today reported consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.

**2024 First Quarter Financial Highlights**

Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 grew 14% to $6.3 million, compared to first quarter 2023 revenue, driven by 9% growth over the prior year in the Therapeutic Devices segment and 86% growth over the prior year in the Diagnostics segment.

* Consumable revenues grew to $4.0 million, up 7% over first quarter 2023 revenues of $3.8 million, and represent 64% of total sales.
* Capital revenues grew to $2.2 million, up 30% over first quarter 2023 revenues of $1.7 million.

Gross margin was 66% for the first quarter of 2024.

Total cash used during the quarter was $9.6 million. When adjusted for non-recurring one-time items, our non-GAAP operating burn was approximately $4.4 million, in line with first quarter expectations and previously provided annual guidance for 2024.

""During the first quarter, we built on the momentum generated during 2023,"" commented Zomedica Chief Executive Officer, Larry Heaton. ""As we continued to execute on our strategy to drive growth in 2024 and beyond, we delivered the strongest first quarter in company history.

""We are seeing the positive impact of our significantly expanded portfolio combined with the growth and optimization of our commercial organization. Supporting the accelerated adoption of our innovative technologies was a series of clinical data publications specifically highlighting the benefits of PulseVet across multiple indications as well as the diagnostic efficacy of TRUFORMA as compared to competitive platforms.""

""Looking ahead, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunity that exists for Zomedica. With our strategy in place to accelerate growth, maintain industry-leading margins, and capture efficiencies, we are very well positioned to scale the business to achieve profitability and grow revenue to $100 million and beyond,"" concluded Mr. Heaton.

**2024 First Quarter Results Review**

Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $6.3 million, compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $0.8 million or approximately 14%. The increase was driven by growth in both operating segments: Therapeutic Devices and Diagnostics.

Cost of revenue was $2.1 million, compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $0.5 million. Margins remained strong at 66%, in line with expectations. Adjusting for our Qorvo Biotechnologies LLC (""QBT"") acquisition and other one-time items brings our gross margin for the quarter to over 69%, in line with recent levels.

Operating expenses were $14.5 million, compared to $11.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $3.2 million or 28%. When adjusted for one-time, non-recurring charges, and expenses associated with ongoing QBT operations, total operating expenses grew just over 20% on a comparative basis. We continue to expect total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue to decrease throughout the balance of the year.

Research and development expenses were $1.8 million, compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $0.9 million or 100%. The increase was almost exclusively driven by the integration of our acquisition of QBT, and investments in acquiring CE marking, attesting to compliance with the European Commission's safety and emissions standards, for our TRUFORMA, TRUVIEW and VetGuardian products, incorporating Artificial Intelligence (""AI"") into our TRUVIEW and VetGuardian products and developing new TRUFORMA assays for launch later this year.

Selling and marketing expense was $4.1 million, compared to $3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $0.7 million or 20%. The increase was primarily due to our growing sales organization and higher trade show expenses associated with launching and marketing additional products at the two largest animal health trade shows which were held in the first quarter.

General and administrative expense was $8.6 million, compared to $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $1.6 million or 23%. The increase was primarily driven by professional fees for specialized accounting work and audit work associated with 2023 acquisitions; and additional fees related to programs associated with regaining compliance.

Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $9.2 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.007 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

\*Non-GAAP EBITDA loss (which includes adjustments for stock compensation) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $7.5 million compared to a loss of $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. When adjusting for non-recurring items our \*\*Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $6.2 million. When further adjusted for on-going QBT integration and associated direct labor costs the loss falls to approximately $5.3 million.

**Liquidity and Outstanding Share Capital**  
Zomedica had cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities of $90.9 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $100.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash was primarily driven by continued operations, additional operating expenses related to the QBT acquisition and other professional fees for specialized accounting work and audit work associated with 2023 acquisitions; and additional fees related to programs associated with regaining compliance.

As of March 31, 2024, Zomedica had 979,949,668 common shares issued and outstanding.

**2024 Business Outlook and Financial Guidance**

For the full year 2024, the Company continues to expect full year revenue in the range of $31 to $35 million, an increase of approximately 39% at the high end of the range, over full year 2023 revenue of $25.2 million.

Zomedica believes that growth in 2024 will be driven by its existing portfolio, including recently launched products, supported by investments the Company is making to continue to drive increased adoption and utilization of its products, as well as contributions from a number of new products that the Company expects to launch during 2024. Guidance for 2024 does not incorporate any positive benefits from acquisitions the Company may make during the year.

The Company expects that on a quarterly basis, revenues should increase sequentially from the first quarter, with the majority of revenue expected to be recorded during the back half of the year.

Expectations: The earnings release for BHVN Q1 2024 does not provide essential financial data such as total revenue, net income, or EPS, which are critical for comparing against analysts' expectations of an EPS of -$1.55 for the quarter. Without these metrics, a precise analysis against the average estimate is not feasible."

| --- | --- | --- | 
| Revenue | $13.8M | 14.0% | 
| Operating Expenses | $110.1M | | 
 | Operating Expenses Growth | 34.5% | | 
 | Net Income | $-91.4M | | 
| Earnings Per Share | $-0.39 | 14.7% | 
| Cash and Cash Equivalents | $296.3M | | 


**Business Highlights**

- On track to read out multiple Phase 2 clinical trials in the coming quarters, beginning in Q3 2024

However, the EPS of -$0.39, although better than the average estimate of -$0.42, still reflects significant losses. Operating expenses grew by 34.5% to $110.1M, contributing to the financial strain."

He’s had a very unrevealing work up so far (normal CBC/CMP, glucose, dexamethasone suppression test, UA - mildly dilute). I’m a 3rd year medical student so I’ve been thinking I was projecting and in my head about it all. I was thinking it was psychogenic polydipsia, but we decided to do an ultrasound with a specialist just to be comprehensive.



Ultrasound Findings:

Liver/Gallbladder: The liver appears to be a normal size with normal echogenicity. No nodules or masses seen. The gallbladder appears to be normal size and contains a small amount of movable echogenic material.

**Spleen: The spleen appears to be a normal size with normal echogenicity. A hypoechoic nodule is present in the body of the spleen measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.**

Kidneys/Adrenal Glands: The left kidney is unremarkable and measures 7.2 cm in length. The left adrenal gland appears to be a normal shape and the diameter of the caudal pole measures 0.50 cm. The right kidney is unremarkable and measures 6.4 cm in length. The right adrenal gland appears to be a normal shape and the diameter of the caudal pole measures 0.48 cm.

Urinary Bladder/Urethra: Unremarkable. No calculi or masses seen. Prostate or Uterus: The prostate is unremarkable.

Gastrointestinal Tract/Pancreas: The gastric wall appears to be a normal thickness with no loss of layering. The pancreas was not definitively seen however no abnormality was seen in the area of the pancreas. The small intestinal and colonic walls appear to be a normal thickness with no loss of layering.

Lymph nodes: No lymphadenopathy seen. Other: No free fluid seen.

**Impression: The splenic nodules most likely benign, such as due to extra medullary paraparesis or lymphoid hyperplasia, however early malignancy cannot be ruled out.**



I was not able to attend this vet visit, so didn't get to ask questions, but my partner said:

“Ultrasound didn’t show anything \*significant\*. They said there was a small nodule on his spleen and that they wouldn’t be able to tell with 100% certainty if it was insignificant or not without a biopsy but that everything they saw in the ultrasound leads them to believe it’s probably not significant and probably not worth biopsying.”

They then recommended an expensive allergy diet that we will trial for a month. But I am not convinced that this is the etiology. The vet was under the impression our dog licks his paws a lot, but he actually just loves chewing on his benne bones and mad his paws look red during the visit. I feel like the nodule was brushed over a bit and so I really divided into the research and was left with a lot of questions. I still lean taking a conservative route, but would love more insight.

* What are the standards of practice moving forward for an incidental small nodule?
* Should we consider serial ultrasounds to monitor it? If so, how often?
* What’s the risk of malignancy? Hemangiosarcoma? I’ve seen studies for incidental nodules that are anywhere from 20-70% and that feels like such a wide margin of error (obviously limited by most research focused on symptomatic hemorrhage patients). 
* What’s the risk of hemorrhage? Should we have a plan in place if this were to occur? Are there any activities we should be careful with to avoid hemorrhage, such as picking him up or him jumping over our couch? What are the mortality/life expectancies of splenectomy if hemorrhage occurs vs beforehand? 
* What ultrasound characteristics make it appear benign vs malignant? From the studies I’ve read it seems it’s fairly inaccurate with many conflicting trends from study to study. ie. one study says smaller is usually benign whereas another it says smaller is usually malignant same goes for the echogeniciy - his is smaller and hypoechoic)
* What’s utility/specificity/sensitivity of FNA? Given the significant RBCs w/in hemangiosarcomas, how often can it be diagnosed? How would biopsy results change the care plan, especially if it were benign? 
* Is splenectomy even for a benign nodule that’s relatively asymptomatic something we should be considering? Would doing a splenectomy outright be wise? Does splenectomy (aside from general surgical complications) have a significant effect on life expectancy or quality of life? Does splenectomy have best diagnostic utility given the ability to biopsy surrounding organs and is that worth the risks?
* How does a splenic nodule effect life expectancy?

"Those of you who have been a part of the SPG community for a while may have noticed that I have gone from being a prolific poster and moderator on this sub to making only rare appearances over the last year or so. I’ve always been fairly private about my health struggles  - no doubt due to some preconceived notions that I shouldn’t burden others or that it would be attention-seeking to do so. Which had me wondering, are there other people like me wrestling with chronic health issues in silence who feel helpless and hopeless because nobody is talking about it? And although my medical issues have placed barriers in front of me that rival Mt. Everest, I can also say that it led me to opportunities that I never would have had when I was “healthy.” So here is a (much abridged) account of how chronic illness led me to SPG and what it means for my future with the subreddit[.](https://imgur.com/a/RFULNo9) 

[There are always two kinds of pets...](https://preview.redd.it/m38urecawfzc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b32d537ad58b500f96f8c4ee44a2a4bc1181bdb6)

It’s a running joke in my family that I would have needed an entire season of House, M.D. to figure out everything that was wrong with me. And of course it was never anything normal or easily diagnosed. So when I started getting excruciating headaches at the age of 16 it took months (and, I kid you not, my mother doing a Google search) before I was diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cerebri (now more commonly known as Intracranial Hypertension). Luckily medical treatments and the power of youth meant I was able to get back on track, graduating first from high school and then from college. I eagerly enrolled in an internship program in London, ready to travel the world and be a badass adult. That was until my little intracranial friend decided to pop back for a visit and I was forced to return home. Recovery took longer this time around, and after several months of bedrest I had a new plan. Perhaps jet-setting businesswoman was beyond my reach, but this could be my sign to pursue something I’ve always loved: gemology.

I enrolled in the Gemological Institute of America (GIA)’s Graduate Gemologist program in Carlsbad, CA and somehow fell even more in love with gemstones. I accepted a position as a diamond grader in the GIA Laboratory after receiving my diploma and life was good - I had friends, an exciting new job, and access to the GIA Library. Except I was suddenly so exhausted that I could barely function, my hair was falling out, and I could barely eat.

The battery of tests began and they found the culprit (or so they thought) in the form of hypothyroidism. I took the drugs and felt much more awake - thyroid hormones will do that - so everything was fine and dandy. Until the medications slowly stopped working and nobody had a good answer. I was eventually placed on medical leave and six months later was let go from my dream job. Once again I packed up my life and returned back home to my parents, weak as a newborn kitten and twice as confused.

I started collecting diagnoses the way some people collect certifications. Can you imagine how desirable I’d look on a resume if those were interchangeable? Liss Manners, IIH, hEDS, MCAS, POTS, OI, GP, ADHD et al. My BINGO card for medical specialists is blacked out and I’m pretty sure my general practitioner back in Carlsbad heaved a huge sigh of relief when I left and became someone else’s problem. Just the battle to get seen or believed by doctors has been a trial in and of itself. I have been on waitlists for months, even years, to be seen by specialists for supposedly rare disorders that are likely just severely underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. And I’m actually rather lucky compared to many of my fellow spoonies - I was a few hours both from Vanderbilt University and their Dysautonomia Clinic and IUPUI’s Ehlers-Danlos Society Program. Without that kind of pedigree backing up my diagnoses, I would still be hearing “are you sure you aren’t just deconditioned?” and “have you tried exercising?” from every doctor.

So there I was: twenty-eight years old, unable to work, waiting for my next appointment or medication. And I discovered Reddit (I was late to the party, don’t hold it against me). At the time, SPG had maybe 6,000 followers and Jim was just starting to dip his toes into jewelry settings. I entered a giveaway and won (a teeny blue spinel octahedron that I still have!) and found myself welcomed into the community with open arms. Let me tell you, it was truly lovely to get to talk about rocks and nerdy gem trivia again. I may have been 90% couch cushion at that point in time but I had found my people. And I also managed to meet my darling husband, u/retribution002, who was thrilled to learn that I was in fact not a Romanian bridge troll or a 40-something man in his mom’s basement with Cheetos fingers.

Recovery resembled more of a straight line than an upward slope, but when I was asked to write the occasional article for SPG I jumped at the chance to do a bit of work during my sporadic bouts of productivity. The decision to start tackling emails and moderation was harder, but at the time we were a much smaller community and I only had 5-10 hours of work per week. I don’t know if any of us could have expected the sub to grow so quickly, but it was truly astonishing to watch it flourish. And slowly, bit by bit, the hours started to add up and I believed I was healthy enough to keep up. For someone who claims that History is her favorite subject, I have a bad habit of ignoring my own.

Until my hair started to fall out again.

In typical Liss fashion, I took on too much. What was once less than ten hours of work each week had turned into twenty or thirty hours of constant emails and I didn’t even have the time or mental energy to also do articles or interact with the community - the things that I really loved doing. In the last few months I’ve had to “go on sick leave” multiple times and it has led to delays and miscommunications over emails. Something has to change.

Jim is working towards adding some new people to the SPG team (so if you see Heidi or Cheryl in the emails, make them feel at home!) and I will be rethinking my role in the group and how I can contribute while still balancing my health. Whether this means transitioning to a position that is less time-constrained or working with the new staff to make sure that there aren’t major delays during a flare…I don’t know.

I do know that I wouldn’t be where I am without all of you. Having such a supportive community means everything, and I’ve been so grateful to have the opportunity to contribute and be a part of it. Y’all aren’t getting rid of me, don’t you worry. I have lots of ideas for future content percolating in my frazzled little brain, and a few measly medical disorders haven't stopped me before.

TL;DR: I'm going through some health stuff and stepping back from a public role at SPG for a while to focus on short term recovery and developing a sustainable long term plan. Please give Jim a bit of time to sort things out with emails and current projects. I love you all and my nurses (Shadow Catto and Lillibutt) are taking good(?) care of me. And for anyone else out there who is going through something similar, remember - you don't have to go through it alone."

"A big part of our problem is damage to the auditory nerve synapse (where it connects to the cochlea). Simply losing hair cells with age vs destroying them with noise/drugs is the difference between hearing loss with or without tinnitus. When you destroy them with noise it also damages the synapse. Hair cells can only be regenerated using various chemicals and gene therapies and that science is still in its infancy. Regenerating synapse damage is in a more advanced state. If this drug which is entering phase 2 clinical trials works to heal this damage, then we will finally have a treatment. This is the best thing on the horizon.

"I spent quality time looking for research on Jett Plasma Pen and plasma energy for MGD/DED and did not find much directly related to the Jett Plasma Pen or any directly related to DED/MGD either. Yet, clearly the treatment is happening, particularly in Europe for DED/MGD likely since the Jett Plasma Pen is approved  for use in the EU.

I don’t know exactly what to make of that. Could be my research skills, but I doubt that since I have found plenty of research on plenty of other treatment approaches. Now there is a lot of research of plasma energy being used in medicine and some in ophthalmology for people with issues other than DED/MGD. Particularly in aesthetic medicine, dermatology, wound care and surgery. For example these in ophthalmology on cornea issues:

*In the medical community, the terms ""cold energy plasma"" and ""hot energy plasma"" generally refer to different states of ionized gas, known as plasma, used for various therapeutic applications and researched a lot. Here’s how they differ per ChatGPT 4.0:*

Cold Plasma:

Temperature: Cold plasma operates at or near room temperature, making it suitable for application on or near human tissue without causing thermal damage.

Mechanism: It works primarily through the generation of reactive species and ions that can interact with biological tissues. These reactive particles can induce specific biochemical responses.

Uses: Cold plasma is used in dermatology for skin rejuvenation, wound healing, and disinfection because it can effectively kill bacteria and stimulate tissue regeneration without harming the skin. It's also researched for cancer treatment, where it might induce cancer cell death while sparing healthy cells.

Hot Plasma:

Temperature: Hot plasma is much higher in temperature, typically in the thousands of degrees Celsius. It is not applied directly to the body but is used in devices that require plasma’s properties at high temperatures.

Mechanism: The energy of hot plasma comes from the kinetic energy of its particles, including ions and electrons, which are much higher than in cold plasma.

Uses: In medical tools, hot plasma can be used in surgical applications, such as plasma scalpels for cutting through tissue or cauterizing wounds. The high temperature allows precise cuts and can reduce bleeding by sealing blood vessels.

The primary difference lies in their application methodologies and temperature ranges, which define their suitability for direct or indirect medical applications.

In this case to help me find research I asked the following of ChatGPT 4.0:

**What can you tell me about the medical research on Jett Plasma treatment for Dry Eye Disease and Meibomian Gland Dysfunction?**

ChatGPT 4.0 Answers:

Research into the use of Jett Plasma treatment for Dry Eye Disease (DED) and Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is still emerging, with clinical trials and studies being conducted to evaluate its efficacy and safety. The focus is largely on how plasma energy can be used to improve ocular surface health and gland function. Here are some key aspects of the current research in this area:

**Mechanism of Action**

The theoretical basis for using Jett Plasma in treating DED and MGD hinges on its ability to:

Stimulate cellular regeneration: Plasma energy may help in regenerating damaged or dysfunctional cellular structures in the eyelids and ocular surface.

Reduce microbial load: Plasma has antimicrobial properties that could reduce the bacterial load on the eyelids, potentially addressing one of the contributory factors in MGD.

Improve gland functionality: By delivering energy directly to the Meibomian glands, Jett Plasma might help in unblocking the glands and improving the secretion and quality of meibum.

Clinical Trials and Studies

Pilot studies: Initial pilot studies often focus on assessing the safety of the Jett Plasma treatment, looking for any adverse effects or immediate benefits in treating DED and MGD.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs): More rigorous RCTs are required to provide reliable data on the efficacy of the treatment. These studies compare outcomes from patients receiving Jett Plasma treatments with those receiving standard treatments or placebo.

Longitudinal studies: Long-term follow-up studies are crucial to understanding the longevity of the treatment effects and any long-term complications or benefits.

Research Findings

Early research findings have suggested some potential benefits, including improvements in symptoms of DED and signs of MGD, such as reduced gland blockage and increased lipid layer thickness. However, comprehensive results and peer-reviewed studies are needed to validate these initial findings.

Current Status

As of the latest updates, comprehensive large-scale results are still pending. The medical community awaits more detailed data from ongoing or future studies that could corroborate the preliminary positive outcomes and clarify the role of Jett Plasma treatment in routine clinical practice.

*I could not find any research studies at all on*

**Considerations for Future Research**

Future research will need to address several aspects:

Standardization of treatment protocols: Determining the optimal settings, number of treatments needed, and intervals between treatments.

Patient selection criteria: Identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from Jett Plasma treatments.

Comparison with existing therapies: Evaluating how Jett Plasma stands up against current standard therapies for DED and MGD in terms of effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

For patients and practitioners interested in the latest developments in Jett Plasma research for DED and MGD, staying informed through clinical trial registries or publications in ophthalmology journals is advisable. Engaging with specialists who are involved in research or who keep up with the latest treatments can also provide valuable insights and access to new therapeutic options as they become validated and available.

Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be direct references or focused studies on the Jett Plasma Pen's application specifically for Dry Eye Disease and Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. It seems the usage of plasma technology in these conditions is still an emerging field or not extensively documented in the available literature.

*So there we go. I will have to leave it at this point. Maybe some readers will be able to point us to specific research using the plasma energy tools at some point.*"

"**AstraZeneca (AZN)** 1Q24 revenues grew by 19% Y/Y, driven by strong product demand, with core earnings per share up 13%. Therapy areas led, with oncology and biopharma exceeding $5 billion in quarterly revenue and rare diseases surpassing $2 billion. Notable growth outside China, fueled by AstraZeneca’s sustained market presence, also contributed significantly.

Pipeline momentum remains strong, highlighted by positive trial results for LAURA and ADRIATIC in lung cancer, both selected for ASCO's plenary session. Key approvals, including Tagrisso in lung cancer and Ultomiris in NMOSD, position the company for revenue potential looking towards 2030.

AstraZeneca saw operating cash flow of $2.5 billion and plans for increased CapEx to support manufacturing capacity expansion for forecasted growth. Recent acquisitions such as Icosavax and Gracell align with strategic plans to bolster the company's radiopharmaceutical and rare disease capabilities, despite expected finance expense increases due to these business developments and debt refinancing.

Looking ahead, AstraZeneca reiterates total revenue and core EPS guidance for the year (constant currency basis). Also, management announced a 7% dividend increase.

The call also highlighted several risks, including:

1/ Regulatory and Pricing Pressures: Several references were made to uncertainties regarding value-based pricing (VBP) in China for Farxiga and the anticipation of mandatory price discounts in Japan for Imfinzi. Such pricing pressures could affect future revenues. Similarly, regulatory decisions and policy changes might pose risks to product approvals and market access.

2/ Dependence on Key Products and Pipeline Success: The company's growth strategy heavily relies on the success of key products like Farxiga, Tagrisso, and Tezspire, along with pipeline candidates such as those from the oncology segment (e.g., Dato-DXd, Truqap). Any setbacks in clinical trials, unexpected safety issues, or competitive dynamics could materially impact projected revenues.

3/ Market Access and Commercialization: The company is investing in promotional efforts to support the growth of newer medicines, such as Airsupra and Wainua, and rare disease treatments like Ultomiris. The ability to gain market access, manage payer negotiations, and drive adoption among healthcare providers will be critical to achieving revenue targets for these products.

**Summary Of Last Earnings call:**

In the CytomX Therapeutics First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call, the company discussed the positive initial Phase 1a dose escalation data for monotherapy CX-904, their EGFR-targeted PROBODY T-cell engager. The company highlighted the strong financial position with $150 million in cash at the end of Q1 and ongoing progress in their broad pipeline.

The CX-904 program showed promising early signs of anti-tumor activity, including confirmed responses in pancreatic cancer, a difficult-to-treat tumor type that typically does not respond to current therapies. The Phase 1 study also demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with minimal cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome observed.

The company is considering moving forward with step dosing strategies for Phase 1b to explore higher target doses and potential combinations with other therapies. The EGFR expression levels did not seem to correlate with response, and the stable disease patients had varying durations of response.

Overall, CytomX is optimistic about the potential of CX-904 and their broader pipeline in addressing unmet needs in oncology. The company remains focused on transforming lives with safer and more effective therapies.

"### 🚨 High-Risk Biotech Stock: Aldeyra Therapeutics 🔬

Aldeyra Therapeutics (ALDX) is a biotech company that has been making waves, but not necessarily for the right reasons. Their lead drug candidate, NS2, was touted as an ""aldehyde trap"" for treating inflammatory diseases, but the concept had yet to prove effective in humans at the time of their stock offering. 🤔

As an emerging growth company, Aldeyra was able to make limited disclosures in their prospectus, leaving investors with less information and potentially higher risks. 📃

The company's prospectus was a stark reminder of the substantial risks involved, including:

* 🔴 Significant operating losses since inception in 2004, with expectations of continued losses for years
* 🔴 Unproven efficacy of NS2, as it had not entered clinical trials or obtained regulatory approvals
* 🔴 Uncertainty regarding securing sufficient funding to complete necessary trials
* 🔴 Potential challenges in obtaining orphan drug designation

Just curious what would happen if you did. I’m just went up to 7.5 myself. Not planning to try it but was just wondering if someone stalled and went over the 15. Obviously the clinical trials capped at 15 for a reason. I see people talking about stacking with other meds so it seems there are a lot of experimental folks out there. 


"Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue, leading to difficulty breathing and impaired lung function. While there is no cure for pulmonary fibrosis, various treatments and therapies aim to manage symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve quality of life. Here are some common treatments:

**Medications:**

Corticosteroids: Drugs like prednisone may be prescribed to reduce inflammation in the lungs and slow the progression of fibrosis. However, long-term use of corticosteroids can have significant side effects and is often limited to specific situations.Immunosuppressants: Medications that suppress the immune system, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, may be prescribed in some cases to reduce inflammation and slow scarring in the lungs.Antifibrotic Drugs: Two medications, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These drugs can slow the progression of fibrosis and improve lung function in some patients.

**Oxygen Therapy:**

Supplemental oxygen is often prescribed to relieve shortness of breath and improve oxygen levels in the blood. Oxygen therapy can help patients with pulmonary fibrosis perform daily activities more comfortably and improve their quality of life.

**Pulmonary Rehabilitation:**

Pulmonary rehabilitation programs offer a comprehensive approach to managing pulmonary fibrosis. These programs typically include exercise training, education about the disease and self-management strategies, breathing techniques, and nutritional counseling. Pulmonary rehabilitation can improve exercise tolerance, reduce symptoms, and enhance overall well-being.

**Supportive Therapies:**

Smoking Cessation: Quitting smoking is essential for patients with pulmonary fibrosis, as smoking can worsen lung function and accelerate disease progression.Nutritional Support: Maintaining a healthy diet and adequate nutrition is important for patients with pulmonary fibrosis to support overall health and strength.

**Lung Transplantation:**

For some patients with advanced pulmonary fibrosis and severe respiratory impairment, lung transplantation may be considered. Lung transplantation can improve survival and quality of life in carefully selected candidates.

**Clinical Trials:**

Participation in clinical trials may offer access to new and emerging treatments for pulmonary fibrosis. Researchers are constantly investigating potential therapies to better understand the disease and develop more effective treatments.

**Palliative Care:**

Palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life for patients with pulmonary fibrosis by managing symptoms, providing emotional support, and addressing end-of-life care needs. Palliative care specialists work collaboratively with the patient's medical team to provide comprehensive care and support.

Treatment for pulmonary fibrosis is tailored to each individual based on the severity of the disease, symptoms, and overall health status. It's essential for patients to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and goals.

"I wonder how close we are to a treatment or cure that can reverse TED, without the hearing loss issues that Tepezza has. Aside from participating in clinical trials, how can we help push this to the forefront of science? Any medical experts or scientists who could have a reasonable guess? Am I going to be waiting 5+ more years in pain?

Besides Tepezza, I don’t know how long research has been in progress for this, especially for not only those with Graves but Hashimotos and other thyroid conditions. They say TED is a rare disease but I’m not so sure it is. It feels like a lot of people have it and don’t realize they do, or have TED but minimal to moderate TED — which does a different kind of damage to the eyes and vision from what I understand from the lack of bulging."
"Hi everyone,

I know this sub is more for those who work in the industry but I’m hoping maybe I could get some tips on trial applications. I’m interested in a clinical trial for a disease I have and I’m having trouble getting in touch with the research team. I fit the eligibility requirements. I submitted an interest form with basic contact info and left a short message about my age, gender, and diagnosis with the school performing the trials. I got a follow up response; probably an automatic thing- that sent the trial’s contact person info. I sent them an email last week and left them a voicemail this week and have gotten no response back. I’m curious if this is normal and I should just continue to wait for a response, or if I should try reaching out again. I’m sure the clinical staff are a busy group and I don’t want to bother them too much if that’s unnecessary. For those working in the clinical trial industry, at what point do you contact interested participants? "

"Hello world. Please humor me and my long post.  

I’m very interested in understanding my cognitive profile better, and want to do also take an IQ test which is not impacted by my specific learning disabilities.

A bit about me: diagnosed with mild cerebral palsy as an infant. Did well at school but always took a while for things to “click” and I had to study v hard. 
Whilst I did reasonably ok in maths, I really struggled with mechanics. Even though I studied very hard I got a D grade and never really understood why and wonder if my poor block design score could explain this .

I was thought to be the “dim one” amongst 5 children growing up because I worked so hard compared to my siblings. 
Im now a physician, and also done a PhD (not technically challenging a PhD in clinical trials with some meta-analysis/validation statistics). I’m now doing a post doc in machine learning.

I get that working hard is just as important as intelligence but a part of me is disappointed. I feel like the test I have shared affirms this belief. I am surround by people who excel/brilliant etc so know I shouldn’t but always compare myself and think about my “average” or even poor cognitive profile with poor working memory. I know it’s daft and I’d tell someone else they are being ridiculous but still. 

I took this exam during my PhD aged 30. Told to go for an assessment because my supervisors didn’t like my writing. Assessor said he was amazed I got to that point without anyone picking it up before.

During this assessment- they suggested I have dyslexia and dyspraxia. I have since been diagnosed with mild adhd (combined type) and have recently started medication.

I struggle with some confidence issues. Ie I feel I’m not really smart and perhaps only get to where I am because I work hard and a fraud. Probably compounded by my PhD experience. Supervisors told me to quit PhD and leave medicine because of my diagnosis. That was a while ago and I haven’t had any negative experiences since. Done therapy, really don’t think anything will help change this belief unless I do something objective eg IQ test. Right now I have objective evidence to affirm my belief system.

Also, Even though I got feedback, I still struggled to understand what my weaknesses really are and the best learning approach for me. I have one more year of my machine learning post doc and really want to finish it. 
Mostly, how to improve skills in coding and the big thinking part eg how to prepare data etc for machine learning modeling. 

Appreciate all suggestions and constructive feedback. 

Thanks for listening to my ted talk!

"You may have read my freakout about the Fumi/Vadim Swan Lake a few days ago lol, at the end of which I said I'd come and review The Winter's Tale, so here it is! A few days late but I promptly fell asleep after getting back to my hotel and then forgot abt it lol

Overall I liked it very much. In the key role of Leontes, Matthew Ball was suitably jealously unhinged and really portrayed his heartbreak and remorse later on in the ballet very well. His reunion with Perdita was very moving. Great performance overall (I will say though, at multiple occasions during the performance all I could think was ""man I wish I could have seen Ed Watson in this"" - I've only seen him do this role on the recording but he's such a distinctive dancer and it's so blatant the role was choreographed on him that I really feel like it would have made the ballet a totally different experience).

The highlights for me were the following:

Pedita and Florizel: The day started with me receiving a cast change email; after promptly shitting myself at the prospect of not seeing Marianela, I was relieved as hell to see it was for Perdita and Florizel. Now don't get me wrong I'm obviously not glad Will Bracewell was injured (hope he recovers soon!) but tbqh I couldn't really see him and Naghdi in these roles so getting Viola Pantuso and Joseph Sissens instead was an unexpected bonus for me. They more than met my expectations. Pantuso was lovely, youthful, lyrical, very sweet, and Sissens was just an absolute STAR who needs to be promoted to principal asap. The charisma, the panache, the chemistry in his interactions with literally everyone on the stage. Promote him!

Paulina: Magri absolutely killed this. Acted her ass of and really made this role the highlight of the whole production.

Hermione: Listen you guys I know some of you think Marianela is too perfect and clinical but I could not agree less. As I expected she was beautiful, regal, dignified in the face of the horrible humiliation her character endures and pleadingly emotional at her trial. Queen.

Now, a common complaint among the good people at Balletco is that the music is unmemorable, which I agree with to an extent, but not entirely. Does it have bangers like Tchaikovsky ballets, is it catchy like your average Adam or Minkus ballet? Absolutely not, but I think the music is suitably evocative of the mood it tries to convey and I actually do find some bits quite hummable and memorable, so no complaints from me there.

One thing I will say is the bear looked a mess. I swear it seemed like a great effect in the 2014 recording. Whether something has gone wrong since, it was just an off night (or a particularly good night on the recording) or I'm just tripping, I really don't know. Plus I swear the bear was upside down???

On a different, off-topic note, can someone who regularly sees opera at the ROH please tell me if it""s usual for opera audiences to be way more badly behaved than ballet audiences or if I was just unlucky? Bc I saw Lucia yesterday and it was a mess, a constant cacophony of coughs, phones going off, drinking and eating sounds, people with their BARE FEET on the backs of other people""s seats during the interval, the mf in front of me leaning forward every single second of the performance and blocking damn near my entire view of the stage (luckily there were empty seats nearby so I could move). Like - wow.

Damn this ended up long as hell lol but what can you do! I'm back for a repeat Swan Lake tonight, since I already reviewed it I'll spare you the fangirling lol and just shoot a quick comment in the weekly thread"
"I tried a paid clinical trial for cholesterol, it was super fast.


TLDR: $45 for less than 10 minutes.

At the Hilton Garden Inn on Wildwood cir.

You make an appointment time, it is performed by care access. I did this in another city and told a friend I'm Birmingham and she signed up. they are searching for a genetic variant of cholesterol that is hereditary. I made an appointment for 10:45 this morning, showed up at 10:40 and was out by 10:52. You read a disclosure, they take 2 vials of blood and you're done. They even made sure I got the email of the visa gift card before I left. 

I have an affiliate link to sign up.

Full disclosure, I do get a kickback for using this specific link. They provide you with a referral code to share with your friends when you leave as well. I have done several trials in the past. Most are filled with waiting rooms, endless forms, and multiple people to talk to. This was the absolute fastest I've ever done one.

"Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that originates in the lungs, primarily caused by smoking but can also develop in non-smokers due to various factors. Here's an overview of its types, stages, symptoms, and treatment:

**Types of Lung Cancer**

**1. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):**

- Adenocarcinoma: Most common type, often found in non-smokers and women.

- Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Usually found in the central chest area, associated with smoking.

- Large Cell Carcinoma: Less common and tends to grow and spread quickly.

**2. Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):**

- Highly aggressive and tends to spread rapidly to other parts of the body.

- Almost exclusively linked to cigarette smoking.

 **Stages of Lung Cancer:**

**1. Stage 0:** Cancer is confined to the inner lining of the airways.

**2. Stage I:** Cancer is localized within the lung and has not spread to lymph nodes or distant organs.

**3. Stage II:** Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes but is still confined to the lung.

**4. Stage III:** Cancer has spread to lymph nodes and possibly nearby structures or organs.

**5. Stage IV:** Cancer has spread to distant organs such as the liver, bones, or brain (metastatic lung cancer).

 **Symptoms of Lung Cancer:**

**1. Persistent Cough:** Often accompanied by blood-tinged sputum.

**2. Shortness of Breath:** Difficulty breathing, especially with physical activity.

**3. Chest Pain:** Dull, aching pain in the chest, shoulders, or back.

**4. Wheezing:** High-pitched whistling sound when breathing.

5**. Hoarseness:** Changes in voice quality or persistent hoarseness.

**6. Unintentional Weight Loss:** Loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss.

**7. Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak, even after adequate rest.

 **Treatment Options for Lung Cancer:**

**1. Surgery:** Surgical removal of the tumor and surrounding tissue (lobectomy, pneumonectomy, wedge resection).

**2. Chemotherapy:** Use of drugs to kill cancer cells or slow their growth.

**3. Radiation Therapy:** High-energy rays to target and destroy cancer cells.

**4. Targeted Therapy:** Drugs that target specific genetic mutations or proteins in cancer cells.

**5. Immunotherapy:** Boosts the body's immune system to fight cancer cells.

**6. Palliative Care:** Focuses on improving quality of life and managing symptoms for advanced-stage cancer patients.

 **Emerging Treatments and Clinical Trials:**

**1. Precision Medicine:** Tailoring treatment based on the genetic makeup of the tumor.

**2. CAR-T Cell Therapy:** Genetically engineered immune cells to target cancer cells.

**3. Liquid Biopsies:** Non-invasive tests to detect cancer biomarkers in blood or other bodily fluids.

**4. Clinical Trials:** Investigational treatments to assess safety and effectiveness in patients.

Early detection and timely intervention play a crucial role in improving outcomes for lung cancer patients. Regular screenings for individuals at high risk, such as current or former smokers, can help detect lung cancer at an earlier, more treatable stage. Additionally, smoking cessation and avoidance of secondhand smoke are essential for prevention.

"First meaningful update regarding CTX211 and previously announced pause in trial.  Appears to be back up and running, although 'advance' could be a clever word choice.

""CRISPR Therapeutics continues to advance a Phase 1 clinical trial for CTX211™ for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). CRISPR Therapeutics remains committed to its goal of developing a beta-cell replacement product that does not require chronic immunosuppression.

Vertex has non-exclusive rights to certain CRISPR Therapeutics’ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to accelerate development of potentially curative cell therapies for T1D. CRISPR Therapeutics remains eligible for development milestones and would receive royalties on any future products resulting from this agreement.""

I'm personally pumped about this - huge 🚀 potential. Would love a trial update in coming months stating some are no longer requiring insulin. Favorable preliminary data on a Type I DM cure in the setting of first approved CRISPR therapy (Casgevy now up and running at 25 sites per this company release) would not only send stock to fun places, but would be life changing for patients with these conditions! 🙂

"TLDR: I am a current Masters student at a European university (Drug Development), and I'm struggling with the choice of my future niche. I am 100% sure I want to pursue PhD, but I'd like to make sure that I keep my options open between both Academia and the industry. My choice is between Computer Aided Drug Design and Computational Structural Biology/Molecular Mechanics. I'm looking for insights about both fields, how they overlap, and what do the career prospects look in both.

More info: This is my second Masters. My past education and experience is kinda all over the place - I have degrees in Biochem, Biophysics and Bioinfo. My actual research experience is mostly experimental, in Physical Biochem and Biophysics, but it is admittedly a little outdated - it was around 10 years ago, although it includes university employment. 4 years ago when COVID started I moved to Clinical Trials.

With my current choice, I'm limited by the research landscape in my region, which will be a lesser issue with PhD, when I can actually get paid anything. I am really drawn to the ""hardcore science"" aspects of this field - Quantum Chem, Theoretical Biophysics, Algorithm building. I'd say I have a very solid understanding of Biophysics, Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Biology. I can code, but I'd say I get by more than a programming god level. I'm also interested in AI methods in this field (but like, more Alphafold-like approaches than retrosynthesis analysis). In the future, after a PhD, ideally I'd like to get a postdoc, and then decide between tenure or industry. I don't have issues with teaching or mentorship, but I don't want to work in client/patient facing roles anymore. I searched existing job offers, but they seem to focus on 'have a degree and some experience' more than specifics (which I think will change in 5 years I need to graduate, as there's a great interest in this field among my peers). I'd like to choose something that maximizes my chances of employment and gives me maximum mobility worldwide.

My current choice is:

1. Molecular Mechanics modeling - no AI, which might or might not include receptor-ligand interactions;
2. Algorithms for AI in CADD - very CompSci based and I'm worried I will just waste my biochem/biophys knowledge to become a subpar programmer;
3. Docking studies - I would have a minimal exposition to any algorithms or theory, I would just use existing (and mostly commercial) software to do docking.
4. Quantum Chem-based ab initio calculations - with a professor literally no one ever met and no one really knows what they do (the lab just publishes reviews recently)

I'm looking for literally any insight, especially: which methodologies should I learn to maximize my chance of getting a high quality PhD, ideally in Drug Development. Reality checks are also very welcome!"
"There's some positive news in the fight against pancreatic cancer. OncoSil Medical has announced the successful completion of their capital raise, securing $6.8 million. These funds will be used to advance their OncoSil™ device, a minimally invasive treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a low survival rate. The OncoSil™ device offers a potential new approach that could improve outcomes for patients. The fact that the device is already approved for sale in some countries is encouraging.

This capital raise brings us a step closer to making this treatment a reality for more patients. Let's hope the clinical trials continue to show positive results, and that the OncoSil™ device becomes a valuable tool in the fight against pancreatic cancer.

"Hi all, just saw a cardiologist for the first time today. He's referred me to a clinic in Sydney for a TTT, and said that while he knows nothing about Dysautonomia himself he's happy to trial meds with me to see if anything helps my symptoms- said that how I react to stuff will be a helpful clue to diagnosis.

Initially he prescribed Propanolol, but at the end of the appointment as I was paying he came out and said he'd spoken with a colleague who's more familiar with Dysautonomia, and that colleague recommended I be prescribed Midodrine instead. His reasoning for this is that my blood pressure is on the lower end of normal, so he doesn't want it to drop further.

I've been testing my blood pressure and HR every day for two weeks. From what I can tell my BP hovers around 100/70 or higher when lying down, but jumps up to 120/90 when standing up. I'm confused as to whether my standing HR is hypertensive or not based on just google.... will Midodrine really be fine??

Apologies if there are other posts already like this, I think I'm mostly confused about whether my blood pressure while standing is considered ok or not. He took my pressure while standing at my appointment but didn't really say anything other than 'its fine' lol"
" Hey everyone, some exciting news from OncoSil today! They just announced the results of their entitlement offer, raising a total of $5.3 million. This is on top of the $1.5 million raised in the placement earlier this year, bringing the total to $6.8 million.

This is a great sign for the company, showing strong investor confidence in their revolutionary OncoSil™ brachytherapy device for pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer has a terrible prognosis, and OncoSil's approach seems to be a promising new option for patients.

The funds raised will be used to further commercialize the device and continue clinical trials.  I'm really bullish on OncoSil's potential to make a real difference in the fight against pancreatic cancer. What do you guys think?

"Glycemic load is a measure of how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels. Foods with a high glycemic load, such as refined carbohydrates, cause a rapid spike in blood sugar and insulin levels. This can lead to inflammation and an increase in sebum production, both of which are key factors in the development of acne.

It's important to note that fructose, a type of sugar found in fruits, has a different pathway than other carbohydrates. Fructose needs to be processed by the liver first, but excessive fructose consumption is associated with a higher risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, it's still important to watch out for excessive fruit intake.

Other Acne Pathways Affected by Carbs: In addition to the glycemic load, there are other ways in which carbohydrates can contribute to acne. These include:

1. Gut dysbiosis: Excessive carb intake can lead to an overgrowth of Candida and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), both of which are associated with acne.
2. Insulin resistance: High carb diets can lead to insulin resistance, which has been linked to acne.
3. IGF-1: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a hormone that can increase sebum production and contribute to acne. High carb diets can increase IGF-1 levels.

Low Glycemic Load Diets and Acne: Several studies have investigated the effects of low glycemic load diets on acne. A randomized clinical trial found that adding a diet with a low glycemic index and low glycemic load for 12 weeks improved moderate acne. Another study found that a low glycemic diet combined with metformin therapy was effective in treating male subjects with acne resistant to common treatments.

A randomized controlled trial by Smith et al. (2007) found that a low-glycemic-load diet improved symptoms in acne vulgaris patients. A follow-up study by the same authors (Smith et al., 2008) found that a low glycemic load diet also improved the fatty acid composition of skin surface triglycerides.

Considerations for Cutting Out Carbs: If you're considering cutting out carbs to improve your acne, it's important to ensure that you're getting enough healthy fats in your diet. Otherwise, you may feel depleted and experience other negative side effects.

Another Perspective: It's worth noting that not all studies have found a clear link between glycemic index and acne. A trial by Reynolds et al. (2010) found no difference in acne between groups consuming high and low glycemic index carbohydrates. This could potentially be because macronutrient distribution and fiber content were the same between both groups.

Conclusion: While more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between diet and acne, the available evidence suggests that consuming a diet low in high glycemic load foods may be beneficial for some individuals with acne. If you're struggling with acne, it may be worth discussing dietary changes with your dermatologist or a registered dietitian.

"# The Hormone-Acne Link

A recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine Research investigated the correlation between hormone levels and acne severity. The study found that there was a significant positive correlation between acne grade and levels of certain hormones, including testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) \[1\].

These findings suggest that imbalances in these hormones may contribute to the development and severity of acne. In particular, high levels of androgens like testosterone and DHEAS can stimulate the production of sebum, the oily substance that can clog pores and lead to acne breakouts.

# Natural Remedies for Hormonal Acne

While there are many pharmaceutical treatments available for hormonal acne, some people may prefer to try natural remedies first. Here are some herbs and supplements that may help balance hormone levels and improve skin health:

1. Saw Palmetto: This herb is often used to reduce levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of testosterone that can contribute to acne.
2. Fenugreek: Some studies suggest that fenugreek may help increase testosterone levels and improve symptoms related to low testosterone, such as low libido.
3. Ashwagandha: This adaptogenic herb is believed to help manage stress and may have a positive impact on testosterone levels.
4. Stinging Nettle: This plant is thought to help reduce DHT levels by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT.
5. Zinc: This mineral is important for hormone production, and zinc supplementation may help increase testosterone levels, especially in those with a zinc deficiency.
6. Vitamin D: Often considered a hormone rather than a vitamin, adequate levels of Vitamin D are associated with maintaining optimal testosterone levels.
7. Green Tea Extract: Contains compounds that are believed to help reduce DHT levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial found that supplementation with green tea extract improved acne in post-adolescent women \[2\].
8. DIM (Diindolylmethane): Found in cruciferous vegetables and in supplement form, DIM is thought to support the metabolism of estrogen.
9. Spearmint Tea and Vitex: These herbs may be particularly helpful for women with hormonal acne.

# The Role of Insulin Resistance

In addition to androgens and other sex hormones, insulin resistance may also play a role in the development of acne. Research indicates that administration of sex hormones, such as testosterone to females and ethinyl estradiol to males, can induce insulin resistance in healthy subjects \[3\]. This suggests that both androgens and estrogens can influence insulin sensitivity, although the mechanisms and outcomes may vary.

Furthermore, a study found that progesterone increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial H2O2 emission in nonmenopausal women, which is linked to insulin resistance \[4\]. This suggests that progesterone could play a role in the development of insulin resistance through its effects on mitochondrial function.

The combined effects of estrogen and progesterone on insulin resistance are complex and can be influenced by factors such as the method of hormone delivery (oral vs. transdermal) and the presence of other conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Some studies suggest that certain combinations of estrogen and progesterone can have neutral or even beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity \[5\].

# Conclusion

Hormones play a significant role in the development and severity of acne. Imbalances in androgens, estrogens, and insulin sensitivity can all contribute to the formation of acne lesions. While there are many pharmaceutical treatments available, some people may prefer to try natural remedies like herbs and supplements to balance hormone levels and improve skin health. As always, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment regimen.

"Hi everyone - I’ve loved being part of this community as I was the main caregiver for my brother and got so many great advice and encouragement. He is 42 and has been battling PC stage 4 since Dec 25. He was on clinical trial and did 6 rounds where we saw decrease in his cancer and overall looking positive until he got an infection and was hospitalized for 21 days. He is on antibiotics that’s keeping his liver alive (in case there is an infection) and his bilirubin skyrocketed and thus, can’t do any more chemo. His last chemo was on April 1. 
He has ascites and had parathesies yesterday. Was discharged from the hospital today but his oncologist basically said he will pass within weeks/months due to not being able to do any treatments. 
Anything else I can do? 
I’m having real hard time with this and while I knew he was going to pass I just didn’t realize how in reality it’s hard. 
Any tips on grieving? 
Did you take time off from work and other activities? 
He has 3 little kids and I’m devastated for them. 
Has anyone traveled far to their hometown with stage 4? We want to see if he should go to his home country to rest his soul there but worried about long travel and potential risks

TIA "

"Question: 

What to do when tests don’t look good after surgery? Should we start looking at clinical trials? 

TLDR: My dads CA199 numbers look worse than at diagnosis (~70) after surgery (~580), latest scans looked clean 

Background: 

My dad was first diagnosed in September 2023 with a borderline resectable tumour. After 2 rounds of Neo-adjuvant chemo (nab+gem) he had an Appleby surgery (with negative margins) in December and spent December & most of January to recover. Did 2 rounds of chemo (nab+gem) after the surgery, but in latest test done last week, his CA199 rose to higher than pre surgery levels. Scans came back clean with no sign of tumour. 

CA199 levels: 
At diagnosis: around 70
Immediately prior to surgery (December 9): 35
A week ago: high 500s 

Doctors said it could be due to inflammation, but is prescribing my dad with 2 more rounds of Folfirinox.

Aside from looking at clinical trials and finding other ways to beat the cancer, should my family be mentally preparing ourselves?

Adrian Ghobrial - Published May 8, 2024

A first-of-its-kind Canadian research study is working towards a major medical breakthrough for a brain disorder, believed to be caused by repeated head injuries, that can only be detected after death.

Inside the brain imaging centre at Toronto’s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Scientific Director Neil Vasdev is hopeful that his team is on the cusp of being able to diagnose chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a living person.

Speaking with CTV National News, Vasdev shares that, “If we can detect CTE in life then we can start working towards stopping the disease in its tracks.” That would be a game-changer for untold thousands across the world.

The disorder has increasingly been found in the brains of deceased athletes like football and hockey players, and more recently it has been discovered in military veterans.

Researchers have found that people with a history of substantial repetitive head impacts (RHI), can experience a buildup of a type of protein around the blood vessels called ""tau."" A different strain of tau is also found in Alzheimer’s patients.

A concentration of the CTE-specific tau protein can have life-altering cognitive effects on the living by impacting their cognitive ability, which can lead to depression and even suicidal tendencies.

**A look at the living brain**

Currently, doctors are unable to diagnose CTE in a living patient, though Vasdev and his team of Canadian scientists at CAMH are hoping to change that.

Their work focuses on taking a drug and making it radioactive. Known as a tracer, the radioactive drug is injected into a patient who’s then placed inside what’s called a PET imaging scanner. As the drug travels through an area of the body, doctors can then detect any red flags.

Simply put, using PET imaging and radioactive drugs, doctors can “look at the living human brain,” Vasdev explains.

Vasdev’s hope lies in a new radio-pharmaceutical, that has been optimized to potentially detect the type of tau protein found in CTE, and in the weeks ahead his team will begin a Canadian research study on humans to test its effectiveness.

For many fighting on the front lines of this brain disorder, it’s a positive step. International Research Director Samantha Bureau with the Concussion Legacy Foundation tells CTV News that “for those suffering from suspected CTE, this study can provide an immense amount of hope. A substantial challenge for those who suspect they may have CTE is the uncertainty around the cause of what they are experiencing.”

The hope is that if successful, this study will open up opportunities for better treatment avenues in the future.

“The ability to engage in clinical trials to develop treatments that alter disease progression, by either slowing, or in best case scenarios, reversing or clearing the disease, would completely change how we address CTE in the clinic,” adds Bureau.

Vasdev’s research into concussions began more than a decade ago when he was working at Harvard University.

He shares his belief that “significant strides have been made for looking at Alzheimer’s disease tau, but CTE tau protein is different because no two head injuries are the same and it’s often found in much younger people.”

For Vasdev, it’s a project of passion. His mother is a Canadian military veteran who enlisted in the 1970s. At the time, she was one of the only East Indian women in the army. She has dedicated her brain to CTE research. Vasdev is hoping his work will help his mother, veterans and Canadians from all walks of life.

Vasdev believes that having the ability to diagnose CTE in life “means we could immediately start working towards prevention strategies, treatment regimens and ultimately stopping the disease.” "

It was intended to preserve their remaining insulin-making cells.

>It didn’t work. Four types of Tregs (pronounced T regs) were first extracted and then expanded in a lab before being reinfused.

Bender *et al*. report that a phase 2 randomized trial of a single dose of expanded Tregs showed no efficacy in preserving C-peptide, an indicator of β cell function, in early-onset T1D. This negative in vivo result comes despite the suppressive capacity of the expanded Tregs in vitro, and will inform future studies of the role of polyclonal Tregs in T1D.

"Hello, I am a scribe ambassador with SA. I work with a medical oncologist whose notes are... Frankly crazy. She includes the entire chronology of symptoms and all interventions she has recommended for every issue a patient has. She copies her previous note forwards, so it's not _as_ bad as it sounds,  but navigating her notes and writing for her is sometimes a nightmare. 

I am moving on to a clinical trial coordinator position in July and SA has found a replacement for me... Who speaks English as a second language. She makes spelling mistakes with layman's English and has no grasp on medical terminology. To make matters worse - she is the most timid human being I have ever encountered and apologizes for making mistakes, rather than asking questions to improve. 

We have had 6 in-person training sessions and, while she has improved, it has been at a snails pace. If she progresses at her current rate - It would be better for my doctor not to have a scribe when I leave. 

Management has, as always, been useless in navigating this. WTF do I do? I had a phone call with my doc just now and she said ""Frankly I will not take her as your replacement"" 

I don't have the authority to tell her she's fired. I'm just lost. Advice?"

As for me, I'm 35, live in America, have a B.S. in accounting. I came from doing construction work (and a little bit of retail) and have been in clinical research since finishing my degree in 2021. I love working remote as my wife is also remote so we get to spend a little more time together, there is no commute, and we're free to live pretty much wherever we'd like. And I'm aware that work is work. I just don't think work should make you miserable, stressed, and furious on a daily basis.

Anyone have any suggestions for what I could potentially try for a new career move?

"Hello,

I am a 36 M who is a 2009 BBA and 2014 medical school graduate. I have worked several years in basic, academic, and clinical trial research. Most recently I was working in a pathology laboratory. I have just taken a new position which starts in two weeks as a lecturer in a physician assistant program at a small school in rural Western PA. I also want to pursue my MBA at the same time as in the future I envision myself having some sort of leadership role within a healthcare organization or maybe even a clinical trial manager position within a pharma or CRO. My UG GPA was a laughable 2.8 but I was fortunate enough to get into USD and UNL. I want to start in the Summer term (literally next week) while I work full time and wanted some advice/input about either program. The appeal to USD is that it has a healthcare admin focus but UNL carries a little more weight as far as brand names go. Thanks in advance for your help. "

"Hey, M1 here about to go into our first summer, and everyone I know is scrambling for research. Although I know not everyone does research over the summer and it’s not required for all specialities, I was thinking of doing something. Through a familial connection I may have an opportunity to do some research/help work on Phase 1 clinical trials for pharmaceuticals. However, I’m hesitant to take the potential opportunity since I feel it would be more relevant to a pharm student and not a med student, and would not be especially helpful to me. Am I wrong? 

Also I’m interested in PM&R so it’s not especially related to that field either lol.

"This post is NOT FOR ADVICE, this is an 
OFFMYCHEST post. Off my chest, a confession of sorts. You can have an opinion but your input on the validity of my love or our relationship will fall on deaf ears because I’m not leaving him. So sorry, but I’m not at all sorry. This is my man. Mine. My relationship. Mine. You don’t know him, you don’t know us, and you don’t know everything about everyone because you read a few paragraphs that I decided to GETOFFMYCHEST.

My boyfriend is traumatized by almost dying two years ago ** this is a chronic health condition that went undiagnosed and nearly killed him. He was hospitalized for weeks, and the doctors warned he could have potential brain damage. He lived, thankfully, but it took him about a year to fully recover (in that year he continued to take good care of me.) 
His dad died a year ago *** of the same condition that almost took my boyfriend. We’ve been together for almost 4 years, so I was around for all of it. I was with his family when we were told that my boyfriend might not make it and I was there with him when his dad took his last breath. 

***context.*** edit**

For about a year he’s been depressed. Before that, I was the depressed mess and he helped me through it. I got into therapy and on meds with his help. He’s always been incredibly devoted to me and giving in our relationship. He’s always been willing to pick up my slack when I needed it, and vice versa. He gave me his car, he paid for my tuition when I needed it, he helped me flee my abusive home life, anything I’ve ever said I wanted I’ve gotten from him. This is the longest that I’ve ever had to pick up his slack and I don’t know what to do. He’s always been good at bouncing back after being low but this time is different.

He’s so deeply depressed that I’ve been taking care of everything. I do all of our cooking-  make everything from scratch and modify for his dietary needs- all of our cleaning, I take notice of when he’s running low on things he needs and make sure to get them before he runs out.. I remind him to shower and brush his teeth. We have 4 pets that I do all of the care for. These are all things I’m willing and able to do because I love him more than life. We aren’t married, but I date to marry and I view this as a trial that we can and will overcome. The key word here, is WE. If he wears dirty clothes, his confidence plummets and the low gets lower. If he doesn’t eat well he doesn’t have enough energy to work affectively. Everything I do is helping him spend time on his hobbies, when he has the energy and will to do so. 

I’ve been diagnosed with Clinical Depression, CPTSD, general anxiety disorder, and OCD. I know what it’s like to be depressed. I have survived a few attempts myself and I understand how dark it can get. The issue here isn’t that he’s depressed, it’s that he’s unwilling to do any work to try to help himself. I’m in therapy, on medication and I work hard to keep myself afloat. But I couldn’t have done it without his dedication and support even through his own struggles. 

He has
1- given me his car when mine broke down, he gets a ride to work from a coworker every day

2-paid for my tuition when I felt like I needed to go back to school

3- invested time and money into even the slightest of my interests. From losing weight to video games, books, anything I show even a little interest in he’ll do anything to show he’s paying attention and is supportive of it

4-helped me realize that I was being abused by my mother. The second he realized he got me out of it. He moved me into his family home, he held my hand while I called CPS on my own mother, and spent 3 weeks helping me clean out my mother’s hoarder home she had abandoned in the aftermath. 

5-my sister is important to me so she’s important to him. At one point, I was going for guardianship, and he opened up a high yield savings account to invest into my sister’s future. 

6- when I was depressed, and my medication journey was crazy, he washed my hair when I asked because it felt comforting and it was too exhausting to do myself

Even now, at his lowest, he tries to show his love by surprising me with things I’ll like. 

I could go on and on and on and on about the ways he’s been here for me.

Even his family is starting to tell me I need to walk away, that he doesn’t have the drive that I do. I don’t believe that, I know him. They’re the ones who instilled into him that it was “weak” and “admitting defeat” to need therapy, and that medication for mental health was useless and poison. 24 years of telling him He is simply broken is going to make it really hard for someone to accept that they don’t have to be broken. I know he’s in there, and stronger than any of them by just waking up in the morning. My family thinks I’m working too hard for someone who’s not working on himself and my friends aren’t supportive of my willingness to “do all of this for a man” but he’s MY MAN. Even a post here on Reddit asking for advice on more ways to support him was just filled with comments that I need to walk away because I’m sacrificing too much. 

I don’t believe that there is too much sacrifice for love. The last thing I’ll do is walk away from him. "
"I know y'all like shouty AI-generated DD full of bad analogies, but let's try something different.

ProKidney ($PROK) is a pharma company that is developing a new cell therapy treatment for chronic kidney disease called REACT. About 30M Americans have kidney disease, and about .8M live with kidney failure, so it's very common and there is a lot of money in treatment - just look at the 12b market cap of DVA, a dialysis company.

PROK has made it through Phase 2 and is preparing to start Phase 3 of clinical trials BUT their manufacturing is on pause right now due to an audit of its quality management. They have brought in some new executives and are working on expanding operations over the next few years and opening new facilities in NC with the support of Greensboro and Winston-Salem. They say they have enough capital to survive through the end of the 2025, but plan on start manufacturing again ""mid 2024"".

**Bear Case**

The bear case is pretty straightforward: they are not able to start manufacturing again OR they start manufacturing again but the Phase 3 results disappoint. This is certainly a possibility and a big risk. There is not a lot of news that comes out about the company and it's hard to tell if they are on schedule. There is a real danger they could burn through their cash and go BK.

**Bull Case**

The short-term bull case is that they start manufacturing again in the next few months. This positive news could be a catalyst that brings buyers. A longer-term bull case is that they not only fix their quality issues and start manufacturing again, but also have positive Stage 3 results. This could 5-10x in the next 2 years if things go right.

**Price**

About a month ago, the price shot up on no news. I think this got picked up by some short screener algos and some pharma tracking sites. However, I don't think this is any kind of squeeze play so I don't even want to speak to short interest. The play here is primarily that positive news comes out in the next few months.

Also, it's worth noting that the options for this ticker are not very liquid. There is at least an option chain so you can try to grab contracts, but don't bid-ask spreads are huge and you won't move anything quickly.

Earnings are tomorrow, so hopefully they provide some positive updates about their production.

**Disclosure**

I am long PROK. I am holding shares, $2.50 5/17 calls, and $2.50 6/21 calls. I plan on rolling those contracts forward until there is some news. I see this as a true bet with high risk and high upside.

tldr: PROK is a pharma company on a manufacturing pause and may either go under or see a big upside if they can start up production again."

"Yo, I have recently been looking into Promino Nutritional Sciences and cant help but think they are undervalued at a 12M mc. They've developed a plant-based protein formula that’s reportedly twice as effective as whey protein and are coming out with ready-to-drink products by next year.

They’ve got pretty major endorsements from big names like José Bautista and Jack Eichel, which is obviously super impressive for a company of this size. The market for health and wellness supplements has been doing super well so with a patented formula backed 25 clinical trials, it seems like they've got potential to at least grab a slice of the $50B market which would obviously bring the share price many muplties higher.

Just interested to see if anyone else has these guys on their watchlist.

Also, they just interestingly announced today that they are initiating preclinical studies focused on their product's potential to prevent muscle loss in cancer patients which could be huge.

Any input or thoughts are welcome!"

"(Disclaimer: I eat a keto vegan diet. I have heart disease, clogged arteries and other health issues. I’m really questioning why to eat vegan recently)

I’m having trouble  getting past this and have been for almost a year now. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dean Ornish, Joel Kahn and other cardiologists say to do vegan diets, and often very low fat and with lots of healthy grains. Many of them (Dean Ornish and Esselstyn) have done clinical trials to prove this saves lives. And they often site how other cultures and countries and time periods didn’t have heart disease.

What I struggle with is:

1) the studies are always compared to a standard American diet, which is the equivalent of studying a race between animal types and pitting a turtle (the SAD diet) against a human runner. Yes, the race shows that the human is faster, but concluding that humans are the fastest animal based on that race is silliness. Did you race humans against cheetahs, or horses? No? Then all you proved is that turtles (the SAD diet) doesn’t perform well.

2) these cardiologists mention other cultures, time periods and countries that don’t / didn’t have high heart disease rates (or any in some cases). And they completely ignore Japan and the Inuit, which are fish based. The Blue Zones documentary guy wrote a book and talks about all of these different countries with different eating habits and lesser disease and concludes vegan is the way to go, despite just telling us that in Japan they eat a ton of fish. To keep with the race metaphor, it’s like saying humans are the fastest and then doing a race between a turtle, sloth, crab, some other slow animals, horses, cheetahs and humans, and when the humans come in third, saying that they beat out all animals other than horses and cheetahs, and we can’t explain the humans not winning, but ignore it; humans are the fastest animals on land anyways. Horses and Cheetahs are an unexplained phenomenon but trust us, humans are fastest.

I keep thinking I’m missing something, but keep coming back to the above two points. A vegan, whole foods based diet clearly saves lives but does it save more lives than a diet with some fish would? Is extra virgin olive oil and healthy fats really a problem? Is grass fed beef really bad for you?

Is the mercury in fish the problem with fish and if not for that, a seafood plant based whole food diet would be best? I’m fine with that being the answer, but then would like to hear vegan diets discussed in that context instead of acting like they’re superior. I’d also like to hear of some trials where plant based keto diets were compared to plant based low fat diets, and grass fed beef / mercury free salmon diets compared to vegan low fat diets.

Apologies if this is coming across as a rant. I’m struggling with high oxalates lately (despite eating chia seeds every day) and I’m re-evaluating my diet. Also listening to podcasts with lots of cardiologists and struggling to not turn them off the second I hear mention of other countries in the context of vegan diets and heart disease and no mention of France and Japan or non-SAD diets.

I’m mostly wondering if I’m alone in questioning the logic on vegan diets, and if I’m missing something."
"**Stem Cell Therapy Improves Post-Stroke Motor Function**

Patrice Wendling

May 08, 2024

CHICAGO — Early results from a first-in-human trial some 20 years in the making suggest that neural stem cell transplantation is safe and improves motor function starting at 1 month after treatment in patients with chronic ischemic stroke.

Almost all patients saw some improvement in the primary efficacy outcome of change in total Fugl-Meyer motor score. At 12 months, eight of 12 patients had an improvement of ≥ 10 points — considered **clinically meaningful** — and three other patients reached this threshold earlier.

""Patients improved at 1 month, increased at 3 months, [were] stable at 6 months, and then we saw something we never saw in any of the prior trials we've done in transplant patients — and that is increased recovery between 6 and 12 months, an 11.8-[point] improvement on average (from 9.3 points at 6 months),"" said investigator Gary K. Steinberg, MD, PhD, co-director of the Stanford Stroke Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, California.

The findings were presented on May 4 at the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) 2024 Annual Meeting.

**Limited Treatment Options**

Except for vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) with intensive rehabilitation, which gained US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2021, there is currently no treatment to restore loss of function in patients with chronic ischemic stroke.

Steinberg and his colleagues developed a **human embryonic–derived neural stem cell product (NR1 cells)** 24 years ago. Preclinical data in different models from their lab and others have shown that stem cell transplantation can enhance stroke recovery.

Twenty years later, the FDA gave the greenlight for the current [phase 1/2a study](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04631406) in humans.

The 18 patients were aged **18-75 years** and were 6 months to 5 years out from an ischemic subcortical middle cerebral stroke. They had a modified Rankin score of 3-4 and stable motor deficit, and they had been through rehabilitation. Patients with a stroke lesion < 1 cc or > 100 cc on MRI were excluded.

The NR1 stem cells were delivered through a burr hole and stereotactically injected into the subcortical peri-infarct area while patients were awake. The **open-label**, dose-escalation treatment (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 million cells) included tacrolimus immunosuppression for 8 weeks. Physical therapy was encouraged but not required.

**The final patient will be transplanted in May 2024**, Steinberg said.

Patients had an average score increase of 4.5 points on the lower-extremity motor Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) at 12 months, which was statistically significant.

The upper-extremity FMA score also increased significantly, by an average of 7.3 points.

""That's better than the vagal nerve stimulation trial showed of 5.8 points on average at 90 days and our patients were worse,"" Steinberg said. ""The Fugl-Meyer motor upper extremity [score] was 20 to 50 to get into the vagal nerve trial. That would have meant only five of our patients would have been included.""

Significant gains were also seen with the stem cell therapy in 10-meter gait speed and participation in activities of daily living, measured by the Barthel Index.

**Surprisingly, there was no correlation between clinical response and dose, age, sex, time of stroke to transplant, or stroke volume**, Steinberg said.

Further follow-up will be conducted to confirm these results and investigate mechanisms of recovery, he said. A prospective, multicenter double-blind phase 2b study is also being planned.

**'Idling' Circuits Theory**

If confirmed, the findings, are ""very, very important,"" Steinberg told Medscape Medical News because, until recently, it was believed that there's no recovery after 6 months because the patient's circuits are dead. This study seems to contradict that.

""So, this was a paradigm shift and we've shown this in some other studies injecting into the brain,"" Steinberg said. ""The circuits, I believe, are idling, and my theory is that they are suppressed by chronic inflammation and that somehow putting the cells in — maybe the needle has a role — releases the circuits so they can function and it catalyzes a recovery.

""**You don't need the cells to survive long term. They just need to release their factors [and] stimulate this system**. They jazz up the circuits, and now the circuits function again. It may be very important to combine it with physical therapy, as the VNS trial did,"" added Steinberg.

Adverse events among the 17 patients transplanted thus far included incisional pain or headache in most patients, nausea, fatigue, transient worsened speech in three patients, and asymptomatic chronic subdural hygroma in two patients.

The events were very minor, all resolved spontaneously, none were related to the cells, and all were related to the surgical procedure, Steinberg said. No severe adverse events requiring hospitalization occurred in the first year.

**Cautious Optimism**

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Jonathan Russin, MD, associate professor of neurological surgery at the University of Southern California, Pasadena, was cautious about interpreting what the study's results might mean.

""This sort of pivotal trial for the first-in-human stem cells for stroke represents a large body of work, but I don't think there's a lot of conclusions we can draw until it's done,"" he said.

In terms of possibly better upper-limb mobility with stem cell therapy than was observed in the VNS trial, Russin said that phase 1 safety trials often enroll patients with the least to lose.

""They're going to add another patient to the trial, and then they'll have to present us with the final analysis,"" he said. ""I'm excited though. Cautiously excited.""

*The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Steinberg reports royalties from Peter Lazic US and serving as a consultant for SanBio, Zeiss, and Surgical Theater. Russin reports having no financial relationships to disclose.*

"Hi everyone!


I'm a newbie to weight loss medication and the clinical trial world. On Monday I applied for the Reta trial on the Lily website and I really hope I get in (and don't get a placebo lol) I was wondering about how long it took for participants to hear back? I have an appointment with my doc to get a prescription for weight loss medication but I think I'd rather do the trial. Does it take a while to hear back or are they normally pretty quick? 

Thanks!! "

Dr. Dow’s letter responds to comments made on a recent article published in the *Journal* , “ [Tafenoquine-atovaquone combination achieves radical cure and confers sterile immunity in experimental models of human babesiosis ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sNlIB33SKUiQ7u-rUHD4AHDSW28t7yTYNgt1ZxPVHTnIwQMHUIqK4S4U__UmnnF6rzem_UgLXDzfUehBPiyIrpIn2uvoXwm3hB9UBwxdib3gOxPNVtFkLXpJVnPf1h9MTB7gh0k2czrjK6yAtqFNVuonXPkRdu1lP3eyS5mPVeEqG7LR1swhWWq_ux6vrKZ3i9S107xIk10Lfvy2lgwzIxctrQysnebStj6DC4lW-ScZpBg0GyOP9QsM6rQqTiUiXNkg52SkDqxjD6R4eyjWFtilyFvtzd_Rs0tLtcynRbYsbEmh2lw79yamWWs7IlFQqXF2PtOwN6alJ1bTDi1pMA==).” Those comments, by M Liu M, EM Galon EM, S Ji, and X Xuan, called for more published medical literature on safely and effectively treating babesiosis.

Dr. Dow’s response to those comments outlines plans by 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals to launch a [clinical trial ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2MRlF-7fSXS-phcfFRYH1bL2nJhv3-kAZ6jHkAmRnjRmgoncqc9JYXrAsESto84leh7BUX2Yzrq3KJmBWBT9NOsVuHbvqxEIV91Yx3Lol5ciVC5hgXLvAwmNW2sIk4aiAzgJCIjmrTlaOrb9kCF7lw==)to study the use of **tafenoquine** in treating human babesiosis. The Company plans to begin enrolling babesiosis patients this summer. The study will be the first and only of its kind in the United States to date.

“A significant unmet medical need exists in North America, Europe, and Northeast Asia for new or improved methods of treatment and prevention of all forms of babesiosis, and for clinical trials dedicated to that end,” said Dr. Dow. “In close consultation with key opinion leaders in the field, we recently submitted a clinical protocol to the Food and Drug Administration. We are confident that the results of this study will add meaningfully to the global medical community’s understanding of this very serious, emerging, tick-borne infectious disease.”

The 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals babesiosis study protocol evaluates a triple combination of 800 milligrams of tafenoquine plus the recommended standard of care – which is atovaquone-azithromycin for at least 10 days – versus matching placebo and atovaquone-azithromycin in hospitalized patients with babesiosis.

**Tafenoquine** is approved for malaria prophylaxis in the United States under the product name ARAKODA ® . The safety of the approved regimen of **tafenoquine** for malaria prophylaxis has been assessed in five separate randomized, double-blind, active comparator or placebo-controlled trials for durations of up to six months.

**Tafenoquine** has not been proven to be effective for treatment or prevention of babesiosis and is not approved by the FDA for such an indication.

Babesiosis, a potentially life-threatening disease in immunosuppressed patients, is a tick-borne illness steadily emerging in the United States.

**About Babesiosis and the Tafenoquine Study**  
This study is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial anticipated to enroll at least 24 patients in the U.S. in 2024. The two main study endpoints will be time to sustained clinical resolution of symptoms of babesiosis and molecular cure as determined by an FDA-approved nucleic acid test. The study will be conducted at three hospitals in the northeastern United States.

The efficacy and safety of 8-aminoquinolines, a class of drugs that includes **tafenoquine** and primaquine, for prevention and treatment of malaria is well established. The appearance of several case studies of **tafenoquine** use for babesiosis in the literature suggests that the drug is being used for this purpose in the practice of medicine in the U.S.

There may be approximately 47,000 cases per year in the U.S. based on the observation of 476,000 Lyme infections and an estimated babesiosis coinfection rate of 10 percent.

**About ARAKODA** **®** **(tafenoquine)**  
**Tafenoquine** was discovered by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the current study was funded by the United States Army Medical & Materiel Development Activity. **Tafenoquine** was approved for malaria prophylaxis in 2018 in the United States as ARAKODA **®** and in Australia as KODATEF ® . Both were commercially launched in 2019 and are currently distributed through pharmaceutical wholesaler networks in each respective country. They are available at retail pharmacies as a prescription-only malaria prevention drug.  
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the long terminal half-life of **tafenoquine** , which is approximately 16 days, may offer potential advantages in less-frequent dosing for prophylaxis for malaria. ARAKODA ® is not suitable for everyone, and patients and prescribers should review the Important Safety Information below.

Individuals at risk of contracting malaria are prescribed ARAKODA ® 2 x 100 mg tablets once per day for three days (the loading phase) prior to travel to an area of the world where malaria is endemic, 2 x 100 mg tablets weekly for up to six months during travel, then 2 x 100 mg in the week following travel.

**ARAKODA** **®** **(tafenoquine) Important Safety Information**  
ARAKODA ® is an antimalarial indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria in patients aged 18 years of age and older.  
**Contraindications**

ARAKODA ® should not be administered to:

* Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (“G6PD”) deficiency or unknown G6PD status;
* Breastfeeding by a lactating woman when the infant is found to be G6PD deficient or if G6PD status is unknown;
* Patients with a history of psychotic disorders or current psychotic symptoms; or
* Known hypersensitivity reactions to tafenoquine, other 8-aminoquinolines, or any component of ARAKODA ® .

**Warnings and Precautions**  
**Hemolytic Anemia** : G6PD testing must be performed before prescribing ARAKODA ® due to the risk of hemolytic anemia. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hemolysis.

G6PD Deficiency in Pregnancy or Lactation: ARAKODA ® may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman with a G6PD-deficient fetus. ARAKODA ® is not recommended during pregnancy. A G6PD-deficient infant may be at risk for hemolytic anemia from exposure to ARAKODA ® through breast milk. Check infant’s G6PD status before breastfeeding begins.

Methemoglobinemia: Asymptomatic elevations in blood methemoglobin have been observed. Initiate appropriate therapy if signs or symptoms of methemoglobinemia occur.

Psychiatric Effects: Serious psychotic adverse reactions have been observed in patients with a history of psychosis or schizophrenia, at doses different from the approved dose. If psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions or grossly disorganized thinking or behavior) occur, consider discontinuation of ARAKODA ® therapy and evaluation by a mental health professional as soon as possible.

Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with administration of ARAKODA ® . If hypersensitivity reactions occur, institute appropriate therapy.  
Delayed Adverse Reactions: Due to the long half-life of ARAKODA ® (approximately 16 days), psychiatric effects, hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia and hypersensitivity reactions may be delayed in onset and/or duration.

**Adverse Reactions** : The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 1 percent) were: headache, dizziness, back pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased alanine aminotransferase, motion sickness, insomnia, depression, abnormal dreams and anxiety.

**Drug Interactions**  
Avoid co-administration with drugs that are substrates of organic cation transporter-2 (OCT2) or multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters.

**Use in Specific Populations**  
Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed a G6PD-deficient infant or infant with unknown G6PD status during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of ARAKODA ® .

"By lunchtime, the payroll office had revolted. 

Three administrators sat in the hallway of the ancient hydro building, pissed off, and waiting for me to arrive.

Within a few metres of their door, I could already smell what this was about. 

It'd happened again, a dead thing above the ceiling tiles. The guy I'd replaced as union rep, a custodian named Charles, had told me the story of a dead squirrel the managers refused to believe existed above the payroll office, going so far as to deny the foul stench making everybody sick.

""They gave in, eventually,"" the previous rep told me on his last day. ""But it was awkward. The custodians, including me, refused to do it. Managers probably didn't want to piss them off. Never piss off a custodian, brother, or man…""  

He didn't have to tell me. I'd been in elementary school the last time the custodians in Bridal Veil Lake public service went on strike. Little ten-year-old me was up to my ankles in trash by the end of the week.

But I digress. Charles had retired, and the ladies of payroll were the union members that needed my help.

""We're not going back in there, Hal,"" Cristi said. She'd worked with hydro since her teenage years and could retire anytime or take a year off sick with all her banked days. She was also the only one who understood the complexity of the antiquated system hydro used to pay everyone. In other words, she was bulletproof to the managers, all younger than her.

I went to her direct manager next. I was new to the union rep job. I wasn't new to hydro. I'd been with the company as a training specialist going on fifteen years.

Basically, I spent most of my day writing instructions and delivering programs to employees. I knew everybody and felt pretty comfortable.

""Payroll is in the hallway again,"" I said, seated opposite the project manager, Geoff, and, surprisingly, Fred, the head custodian. ""There’s a smell. Again.""

The two of them exchanged a glance.

""Hal,"" Geoff eventually said, ""there's no smell in there. It's…""  He looked to Fred, who nodded.

""Cristi hates me,"" Fred said with a shrug. ""I would never refuse something like that. It's an easy fix. I just don't want to deal with her. She thinks she rules the place, and-""

Geoff raised his hand. ""It's a conflict of personalities.""

""And a smell,"" I added. ""There’s definitely a smell, Geoff. I smelled it. Everyone can smell it.""

""It's an old building,"" Fred said. ""Probably a water leak has gone stagnant in the tiles. I sent JJ to look, and he couldn't find anything. There’s no dead animal.""

""It really smells like there is?""

He wasn't wrong about the building though. It's super old. Nikola Tesla helped design it after he'd finished in Niagara Falls and turned the lights on in Hamilton. That was in 1898. 

Bridal Veil Lake got their mini version of hydroelectric AC power the following year. The only older building that I know of is Buchner Collegiate, the high school, which served as a barracks and hospital during the War of 1812. 

And that building has been renovated and updated so many times, you'd only know its age by the clues in the few remaining fragments still standing. 

The Westinghouse Power Station, on the other hand, looks like a castle, inside and out. All of the modern equipment looks out of place, and the drop ceilings are comical. Why put cheap garbage overtop of supposedly amazing stone masonry? 

Maybe to catch all the leaks and piss off Cristi in payroll, I guess.

""We can replace the tiles, Hal,"" Geoff said, a little exhausted. ""But it won't fix Cristi.""

""Does Cristi need fixing?""

He quickly shook his head. ""No, I mean, the thing with the custodians. She always seems to have a problem they can't fix fast enough.""

It wasn't my job to comment or care about his opinion of Cristi. ""When will the tiles be replaced?""

Fred appeared to awaken from slumber. ""This evening?""

""And in the meantime?""

The manager sighed. ""Payroll can work from home this afternoon.""

I thanked them and brought the good news to Cristi and the others. She didn't seem as happy as her younger colleagues, but didn't comment. They held their breath to retrieve their things and went home. 

It felt like a victory until Cristi's brief and concerned look on her way out of the giant, ponderous doors to the parking lot. She opened her mouth to say something, but thought better of it, I guess, and smiled and waved at me in farewell.

Job done. Or so I thought.

The smell persisted. Geoff said Fred was waiting on some replacement tiles. He'd taken out the ones above the door, which were the apparent source of the issue. Yet, it still stank like death.

Geoff could only shrug. I think he was happy with Cristi working from home for a few more days. She could be pushy and authoritative, but I liked her. Plus, she had earned her unofficial leadership role through pure grit. 

Most of the managers, on the other hand, have nice last names and relatives in high places around town. Geoff's dad served as city manager. Everyone knew hydro was just the waiting room for a shithead like Geoff. 

By Friday, the awful odour had spread, moving down the steps to the purchasing department. No argument was required this time. They were all sent home early for the weekend. A bunch of people began wishing the stink would somehow flow their way.

Fred viewed the spread as confirmation of his foul water theory. After another rainy day, the leak had overrun whatever cavity it'd filled in the ceiling. Gravity, he reasoned, and demonstrated with his hands representing the ceiling for some reason, had pulled the excess water to the ceiling above purchasing. 

""Wouldn't the water have to breach the second floor, uh, floor?"" I asked.

""It's an old building,"" he affirmed for me again.

""Yes.""

""Water gets into a place, it's gonna travel down if it can."" He scratched his grizzled beard, and I recognized the beginning of a pointless conversation.

""See ya Fred.""

More tiles were ordered, and he'd get JJ up on the roof Monday.

Case closed.

I'd spent too much time with this issue, and found the need to clock some overtime on Saturday. I didn't mind because I got paid for it. When I rolled into the parking lot around ten AM, I was surprised to see Cristi's car.

The lights were on in payroll. I had a lot to catch up on, so avoided going to visit with her first. She'd come to me, for sure, once she realized I was in, and another tirade about Fred and Geoff and the state of the power station would raise the unasked question: Why not retire?

Around 11, she finally passed by the window of my office. She waved and smiled but didn't stop to chat and seemed in an uncharacteristic hurry. Usually, Cristi approached everything, quite literally, with quiet resolve and certainty. It was weird to see her nervously wringing her hands. 

I peeked into the wide hallway as her echoing footsteps ceased by the elevator. She pressed the call button going up. No official reason to be going to the second floor, where a bunch of crap no one knew what to do with was stored. 

Old equipment and boxes of work orders filled those rooms, and all of it smelled like dirt because some genius thought it'd be cool to carpet over the stone hallways. Rather than rip up the carpets, the next genius decided to relocate the executive offices downtown.

After the elevator elevated away, I snuck up the stairs, thinking I'd give her a surprise. She'd be pissed but not for long. 

Cristi was serious most of the time, and yet not above the odd prank. She'd engineered a jump scare on the other payroll folks last Halloween with a huge, remote control tarantula. 

I stopped at the final step to the second floor when I heard her talking. ""This is stupid. This is stupid. I should just… oh god, it's definitely coming from…""

The rest of her words were lost beneath the heavy chonk of an old tumbler lock. I crouched before I peeked around the edge of the stairwell wall. Cristi held a large, brass key, and braced herself against the room ahead. She held her nose against the back of her hand, and after a moment, I smelt why.

The awful smell came from that room. There could be no doubt. Fred's theory about stagnant water flowing from the roof on down through the floors was wrong. Something had died up ahead. It was so bad. I gagged, and the odour filled my mouth with a rancid taste.

Despite my extreme revulsion, Cristi went in. I tried to call out for her to wait but the words died in my constricted throat. Silence followed her entry. The urge to leave persisted. Nobody should enter such a room without serious PPE. 

But I couldn't leave Cristi on her own. That would be wrong. I was the rep. 

So I followed, against every instinct telling me to run. The fear prickling my skin, driving cold sweat through my pores, was about more than a bad smell. There were too many irregularities. Something bad had happened in that room.

Cristi had activated the flashlight app on her phone. In her other hand, she held a bloodied knife. 

A yelp escaped between the fingers of my hand as I covered my mouth. Cristi turned and the light blinded me to everything but the knife.

""Hal,"" she whispered, only mildly surprised. ""What are you doing here?"" 

I couldn't answer. I watched the blood drip from the tip of the knife into the dark and smelly carpet.

""Hal? Hal?""

I started to back away before I decided to run. 

""What are you doing, Hal?""

I bolted. Cristi shouted something. I leapt to the first landing of the stairs. I'm not a jogger but Cristi's old and wore heels, the worst shoes imaginable for a murderous pursuit.

Her shrieks echoed in the stairwell, chasing me out into the first floor corridor. I needed my phone. The door to my office was closed and locked. I don't remember if I shut it or not but the handle is always locked. 

I didn't fuck around with keys. Cristi was coming, slowly, and if she had already killed somebody, even an animal - hopefully an animal - she had one more notch in her belt than I. I hadn't even been in a fight since I was a kid, and I certainly lost that one.

Away from the hallway, toward payroll in fact, I didn't notice the puddle beneath the exposed ceiling tiles. Glass from the office window shattered from the impact of my shoulder as I slipped wildly. 

""Holy shit, Hal. Are you okay?"" Fred asked, suddenly there with Geoff. They were walking out of Geoff's office together. Half-embedded in the window, I declined to answer. ""Why were you running? What the hell is all over the floor?"" 

""It's blood,"" I said, completely out of breath from the run and panic. ""Cristi, she's right behind me. She…""  Should have caught up by now. 

""Jesus, what’s going on, Hal?""  Geoff stepped carefully around the pool of blood growing steadily beneath a steady drip from the ceiling. He looked where I'd been running. ""Is Cristi with you?""

""No, no, you don't understand,"" I said as Fred helped dislodge me from the window. ""She's done something awful upstairs. I think."" 

Except that didn't make much sense. Why draw attention to the smell with complaints if she caused the smell in the first place? The blood on the knife had been fresh.

Fred and Geoff exchanged a look. 

""Why are you guys here?"" I asked.

""Overtime,"" they said in unison.

""Why are you here, Hal?"" Geoff asked. His eyes narrowed with suspicion.

""Same reason as you."" 

A moment of awkward silence and cleared throats followed. 

Cristi finally stepped out of the stairwell where she'd been hiding. She still held the knife. 

""Cristi!"" Geoff said. ""What the hell are you doing?"" He gestured vaguely at the knife and smirked.

Fred appeared more incredulous. ""I knew you were crazy.""

""It's Hal,"" Cristi said. ""I caught him on the second floor, going to the room above payroll.""

""Caught me?"" I said. ""I followed you there, and you already had that bloody knife! That literally bloody knife! Caught me? Caught you!""  I was surprised by my anger, and still scared. It was weird how Fred and Geoff just happened to be there. Cristi too.

""Is that true, Cristi? Did you go up first?""  Geoff had taken on a typical paternalistic manager voice nobody loved. He's younger than all of us. 

""I did,"" she admitted. ""I wanted to see what the hell stank so bad. Well, there's something there alright. I couldn't find out what exactly before Hal surprised me.""

""I was trying to surprise you,"" I said. ""I thought it'd be a funny prank.""

She stared me down. I looked away.

""Hold on,"" Geoff said, ""Fred, didn’t you check up there last week when it started smelling again?""

Fred's already ruddy skin turned a deeper shade of red. ""I was going to send JJ up Monday, remember? Why are you here, Geoff?"" Fred tapped his barrel chest. ""I have a reason to be here.""

""Which is?"" I asked. Cristi chose that moment as some kind of invitation to come closer. I leveled a finger at her. ""Don’t fucking move."" 

She froze. ""Fuck you, Hal.""

Geoff sighed and looked at Fred. ""Which is?""

""I bought some tiles for the ceiling,"" he said, ""on my own time, with my own money. I wanted to replace the tiles now, so none of the custodians had to deal with Cristi."" 

""And fuck you, Fred,"" Cristi said. 

""I was here to catch up on work,"" I offered, ""because the goddamn smell issue took up so much time. We're still waiting for Geoff's reason.""

He shrugged. ""And you'll keep waiting. I don't have to explain anything to you. I'm the boss, remember?""

Cristi laughed and mimed a curtsy, waving the knife around too casually for my liking. ""My liege.""

""This is fucked up,"" I said. ""Time to call the police.""

""Whoa,"" Geoff said, ""wait a second. We don't even know what's up there. Cristi didn’t see anything.""

I pointed to the knife in her hands. 

""I found it there, Hal. I only picked it up in case there were any lurkers around."" She crossed her arms, expertly folding the tip of the knife through the crook of her elbow to avoid cutting herself. ""And there was, so…""

Geoff showed some guts and stepped in the path between me and Cristi. ""Just stop. We're probably squabbling over nothing. Let's all take a breath. And then go upstairs and see what we're actually dealing with before we execute someone for murder."" 

He didn't want the police involved. Anything that got in the way of his progress in daddy's footsteps must be avoided. 

Fred chimed in. ""He's right. Let's just go upstairs, and see.""

Cristi tipped the scale completely. ""Fine.""

""But you leave the knife here."" I didn't want to go. There had to be something in our contract excusing workers from walking into possibly criminal circumstances. 

If I didn’t follow the group, however, I felt like I'd be drawing suspicion from the others. Cristi seemed to think I was guilty of whatever occurred on the second floor. 

I knew it wasn't me. All of us at work on a Saturday was too convenient. Geoff had given no reason for his attendance. Fred had a reason, a fairly plausible one - avoiding Cristi - but was a little too quick to agree to go upstairs. Cristi had literally been caught with the murder weapon, if indeed a murder had taken place.

""I want my phone,"" I said.

""Sure,"" Geoff said, ""let's get it together. All of us. Cristi, the knife?""  He held out his hand and took a few steps toward her.

She chuckled. ""Fat chance, nepo baby."" The knife slid surprisingly far on the smooth stone floor with what seemed like a gentle toss by Cristi. It sailed across access to the stairwell, our proposed destination, inviting the guilty party to go and retrieve it.

Nobody moved. We hesitated. Why? We all suspected the others. I knew, especially, the chances of something upstairs being fucked up, even if it was dead animal, were high. I admit I was afraid.

They all watched through the open blinds of my office while I retrieved my cell phone. I dropped my keys when I tried to unlock the door, and felt their scrutiny heat up the corridor. I hadn't done anything. I had nothing to do with the rot on the second floor. Yet, I took a share of the doubt equally. 

I guess that was fair. As we mounted the steps in stiff pairs, moving slowly, trying to watch each other and up ahead, I wondered how well I knew any of them. Not well enough to be certain they weren't capable of horrible things.

Cristi's perfume mixed with Geoff's liberal use of Axe body spray. Fred bore a layer of sweat that accentuated a normally subdued body odour. The melange caused a sting in my nostrils, early signs of a headache to come. 

But I missed the olfactory mixture the second we stepped onto the second floor. The pungent stench of death made us flinch and hesitate. We covered our faces and breathed through our mouths. 

The dark room exuded silence in addition to dread.

""I do not want to go in there,"" I said, mouthing the words through my fingers.

""Me neither,"" Fred agreed.

Cristi kept her thoughts to herself, and I noticed she had allowed us to move ahead while she lingered closest to the exit.

""It sucks,"" Geoff agreed, ""but we need to do this.""

""Do we?"" I asked. I had my phone ready.

He saw it and became alarmed. ""Please, don't. Look, you're all right about me, okay? I'm a… what Cristi said.""

""Nepo baby,"" she reminded him.

Geoff grimaced. ""But I still care about my career, and my family. If this is nothing, and we call the police, my dad will find out. You know how small Bridal Veil Lake is. Everyone knows everyone. I'll look like a fool if I let something dumb slide… something I should have been on top of, you know? My dad already thinks I'm…""   He let us fill in the blank.

""A chump,"" Cristi filled in. 

""He's not,"" Fred intervened, ""and you know what, Cristi?""

Cristi waited calmly for the answer.

But Fred balked and wilted the same as Geoff. ""Enough,"" he said, ""I'll look.""

To their credit, both Fred and Geoff entered the room. I'd gotten closer than I had on my first visit to the second floor. The carpet squished softly beneath their steps. 

A trail of blood had already been tracked out by Cristi from before. I only noticed it then, however, while Fred cursed about the light switch not being beside the door.

""What are we walking through?"" Geoff asked. Neither had turned on a flashlight. They searched blindly, an idea that frankly scared the hell out of me.

They weren't scared, however, because maybe they already knew what to expect.

Sudden illumination painted the horror with clinical track light precision. A flood of red dyed the tacky carpet. Swells of blood gathered around Geoff's feet.

""No!"" Fred shouted. I couldn't see him. ""No! I didn't! I didn't!"" 

Geoff rapidly tapped on the screen of his phone. I reached instinctively for Cristi, afraid, and forgetting about the bloody knife. She stepped ahead; she held another weapon: an exacto blade, extended. 

""Come on, coward,"" she ordered me.

Fred grunted and whimpered inside the room. 

""Jesus fuck,"" Cristi said when she stepped in. She lowered the exacto knife and waited.

""What is it?"" I asked her. ""What?!""

She ignored me and continued to watch a still unseen Fred as he laboured desperately over something. 

Stepping into there, onto that, felt like trespassing. I didn't belong there. None of us did, and now that we had there was no returning to the normal world.

Dried onion skins littered the floor by the wall where Fred stood. They crushed and flattened beneath his boots as he desperately attempted to wipe the wall with his hands. 

Written in blood, his name, Fred. Not Frederick. No surname. Just F-r-E-D in large print. 

""Yes, that's right,"" Geoff said to a 911 operator. ""Westinghouse.""

""No!""  Fred rounded on us with wild eyes and red hands. ""It wasn't. I didn't. I…""  His ass splashed in the sodden carpet as he sat down. 

He saw the strips of onion surrounding him. We were all so stunned, we looked at them more closely too. Aside from the massive amount of blood and the name on the wall, the crisped bits were the only remaining objects of interest. 

Cristi picked up a piece and squinted. ""What is it?""

""Put it down,"" Geoff said, still on the phone. ""Yes, we will,"" he said to the operator before addressing us again. ""Out. Everyone out. Stop touching everything.""

""It's skin,"" Cristi said, ignoring Geoff, letting the paperthin flesh drift gently to the floor. ""Someone's been cooking up here."" Why did she seem fascinated?

I turned away and saw the clump of bloodied hair before the scalp it was attached too. ""Oh god."" I started vomiting. On my hands and knees, sucking in the stink, knowing its origin, an infinite retch held me captive.

I crawled out into the hallway.

I had to get away. 

One of them had done something awful to a human being. Geoff and Cristi followed shortly after. I hardly noticed. Fred remained inside the room until sirens could be heard. Then he sprang from the doorway and darted into the hall.

""Hold your horses!"" Cristi shouted, stepping into his path. She brandished the exacto blade but to no purpose. Fred clocked her straight between the eyes, and the old lady dropped cold, a bag of bones. 

Geoff and I made no effort to prevent Fred's escape. I was in no condition to even stand up. Geoff is just a prick. 

The first constables found us as Cristi began to awaken. None of us could explain what had happened, and certainly not what had transpired in the bloody room. 

So they told us, eventually.

Someone had been murdered there. 

That much would be confirmed later when I was taken into custody and questioned. The amount of blood suggested to me multiple victims but the body apparently contains an astonishing amount. 

Only one person had died there: Charles, the retired custodian, the rep I had replaced.

Or so the police assumed. Further investigation discovered Charles missing long enough that the food in his fridge had spoiled. They never found his remains but the blood in the room, and leaking below, belonged to him. No one can lose that much blood and still be alive.

""He was peeled slowly,"" a particularly cruel detective told me, trying to get me to admit to killing Charles, I guess. ""It must have been fucking horrible, watching your skin come off, and cooked too. We think they used a lighter. There were bite marks in some of the pieces, Hal. Grotesque stuff.""

That was my last interview and then they abruptly told me to leave. 

Fred had been found. He'd run to the gorge and hung himself from a tree with his belt a few hours after running from the power station. In his blood, the tip of his finger opened with a sharp stick, he wrote a simple confession on a receipt: I did it.

The paper was found in his rotting hand. It had taken the police an embarrassing amount of time to find him. Their excuse was he'd gone to a remote part of the forest, a nature preserve, where there were no maintained paths.

Now do you believe Fred's confession? No? Well, you'll be shocked to know the case effectively closed after his death. Officially, Fred wasn't charged. No trial followed. But the cruel detective I mentioned earlier was pretty candid about the continuance of the investigation.

""Not bloody likely,"" he said. 

I actually ran into him by chance at a bar. Not a slim chance either. I visited all the bars after this incident. So did Geoff. I ran into him too. 

We drank together for a few days and then ended up in a fistfight that saw us banned from the Lucky Snail off Tour Hill. He accused me. I accused him. Neither of us could look at each other once we had no choice but to return to Westinghouse.

Cristi was back before either of us but didn't seem the same. She chose to gradually retire, winding down her hours while she trained a replacement. When I did see her, which was rare, we didn't speak or make eye contact.

Mostly, I sat in my office and drank, watching the door. 

Fred hadn't done it. Were we meant to believe he signed his name in the victim's blood on the wall? Or that the victim had somehow written it before dying? Fred would have then removed the remains but somehow missed the clumsy accusation. 

""Not bloody likely,"" I say like the cruel detective, a lot, to my braced office door. The killer wanders these halls. I'm sure of it. 

I pee in a bucket because I refuse to go out of my office except to leave the building. 

I carry a knife.

Geoff never got his promotion. I still don't really know why he'd been in the building that Saturday. Pulling some bullshit overtime for the extra money? Cleaning up his horror show? Both? Fucking psychopath on the public dime.

Or maybe not.

JJ became the new head custodian and the rep. He never found the tiles Fred had purchased.

That's about the state of things now. I wait for the neat bow to end this ordeal but that's rarely how life works out. 

Things happen to us. We continue living.

The villains get away. 

We pretend they didn't.

There's a room of horrors waiting somewhere for you and everyone.

It's only a matter of time before you're shaken out of everyday life by it. 

The best anyone can hope for is to not be peeled, cooked, and [eaten](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot/s/kahmEkN8pU).

" The Patrick Wild Centre is conducting an online survey to collect views on the potential use of gene therapy in treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). This approach, which targets the genetic factors underlying FXS, is being explored as there are currently no treatments available that address the genetic cause of the condition.

Gene therapy has demonstrated potential in laboratory studies and is being considered for other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. The survey aims to understand the perspectives of families affected by FXS on this emerging therapeutic option.

Your participation is valuable and will contribute to the ongoing research into gene therapy for FXS. Please consider providing your input by participating in the survey.

"I am looking for a Ketamine Assisted Therapist, and want to know what questions I should be asking in order to vet potential providers. 

I've talked to a few so far and have gotten wildly different cost estimates and online research in my area( Los Angeles/Orance County) shows a wide variety of providers with different credentials. Everything from some that seem very into the therapy process and others that are more the med-spa. 

At the bare minimum I want a prescreen, preparatory session(s), and then 3-6 ketamine infusions in office overseen by a trained professional who can step in if things go badly. 

Below is a synopsis of my situation for why I seek this more managed approach. I am afraid of making things worse by having an inexperienced care team or being taken advantage of just for money. 

Here are my questions so far- what should I add?

1. What is the care team? Who provides integrative therapy, who determines the type of ketamine used and at what dosage? What is the training and experience of these providers? 

2. What is the cost?


Synopsis:

I seek KAT for depression/MDD. Diagnosed 20 years ago, and on anti-depressants for most of the time since. I've been in therapy with several different modalities, most recently IFS/trauma work/EMDR and I'm still struggling. Sometimes I do better than others, but overall it's a significant handicap to living. I had a major life event at the end of 2023 and have been increasingly circling the drain since then, with more feelings of hopelessness than ever. 

I went off anti-depressants eight months ago because of reduced efficacy and side effects. I wanted to stay off in the hopes of a clinical trial for psilocybin but haven't been able to find one. Ketamine has been brought up as an alternative. 

After discussions with regular doctor and therapist I went back on meds (prozac, different than prior AD) a few days ago. I resisted for some time but agree that something had to change now to support day to day function. 

Thanks"

"* The study met its primary endpoint achieving clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions across all TEV-‘749 dose groups versus placebo in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, a widely used assessment tool for schizophrenia symptom severity
* TEV-‘749 was well tolerated, with no incidence of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) observed to date: additional safety data is being collected as part of the long-term follow-up SOLARIS study
* TEV-‘749 is being developed by Teva as a once-monthly subcutaneous long-acting injection of olanzapine with the use of SteadyTeq™ technology, a copolymer technology proprietary to Medincell

PARSIPPANY, N.J. & TEL AVIV, Israel & PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Teva Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA), and Medincell (Euronext: MEDCL), today announced results from the efficacy portion of the Phase 3 Subcutaneous OLAnzapine extended-Release Injection Study (SOLARIS) trial evaluating TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia compared to placebo. Results demonstrated that TEV-‘749 met its primary endpoint as measured by a change in the PANSS total score from baseline after 8 weeks compared to placebo. TEV-‘749 utilizes SteadyTeq™, a copolymer technology proprietary to Medincell that provides a controlled steady release of olanzapine, the most prescribed 2nd generation antipsychotic for schizophrenia in the U.S.1

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508366301/en/

TEV-‘749 met its primary endpoint across all three dosing groups, with mean difference in change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score from baseline to week 8 of -9.71 points, -11.27 points, and -9.71 points versus placebo for the high, medium, and low dose groups, respectively. These differences from placebo were clinically meaningful and statistically significant with adjusted P-values of <0.001 for each comparison. Key secondary endpoints of CGI-S (Clinical Global Impressions – schizophrenia) and PSP (Personal and Social Performance Scale) total score were also statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity. No cases of PDSS have been reported to date, after administration of approximately 80% of the target injection number.

An estimated 3.5 million people are currently diagnosed with schizophrenia in the U.S. It is a chronic, progressive, and severely debilitating mental disorder that affects how one thinks, feels and behaves. Currently, there is no long-acting olanzapine treatment option available for schizophrenia that does not risk post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS). PDSS is characterized by the sudden and unexpected onset of delirium or sedation within the first several hours of receiving treatment and has been associated with the intramuscular injection of long-acting olanzapine.

“These encouraging results from the efficacy portion of our Phase 3 SOLARIS trial demonstrate the potential of TEV-‘749 to be an effective long-acting treatment option for schizophrenia and further show our dedication to advancing innovative science in mental health and beyond,” said Eric Hughes, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer at Teva.*“*Schizophrenia can be a devastating disease for both the people struggling with it as well their families. Schizophrenia is often a chronic life-long disease, but by using medication consistently, people can find the treatment help they deserve. This also has the potential to reduce the burden for not only themselves, but their caregivers and loved ones as well.”

The PANSS is composed of 3 subscales: Positive Scale, Negative Scale, and General Psychopathology Scale. Each subscale is rated with 1 to 7 points ranging from absent to extreme. Each of the 30 items is accompanied by a specific definition as well as detailed anchoring criteria for all seven rating points. These seven points represent increasing levels of psychopathology, as follows: 1- absent 2- minimal 3- mild 4- moderate 5- moderate severe 6- severe 7- extreme; the PANSS overall total score ranges from 30 to 210, with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity. The primary efficacy endpoint was measured by change from baseline to week 8 against the PANSS total score.

“These data reinforce the potential of TEV-‘749 as a subcutaneous long-acting injectable by using a proven molecule with an established long-acting delivery system,” said Christoph Correll, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at the Zucker School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY and SOLARIS study co-ordinating investigator. “Most patients with schizophrenia will experience one or more relapses throughout their treatment journeys, so I very much welcome the development of new and innovative long-acting treatment options that may better fit into their lives.”

“The positive news from the phase III SOLARIS trial continues to encourage ongoing innovation in treatment options for those living with schizophrenia. We are thrilled to be part of this journey with Teva through a strong partnership that allows us to leverage our pioneering long-acting technology for the benefit of patients,” said Christophe Douat, CEO of Medincell.

Additional efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 3 SOLARIS study are planned for presentation at a medical meeting later this year.

The long-term safety of TEV-‘749 and incidence of PDSS are also being evaluated in the SOLARIS open-label study (period 2) with safety data topline readout expected in the second half of 2024.

TEV-‘749 is an investigational once-monthly subcutaneous long-acting injection of the 2nd generation antipsychotic olanzapine and is not approved by any regulatory authority for any use and its safety and efficacy are not established.

**About Subcutaneous OLAnzapine Extended-Release Injection Study (SOLARIS)**  
SOLARIS is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olanzapine extended-release injectable suspension for subcutaneous use as a treatment in patients (ages 18-65 years) with schizophrenia. For period one of the study (first 8 weeks), 675 patients were randomized to receive a subcutaneous injection of once-monthly TEV-‘749 (low, medium or high dose) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. For period two, which will last for up to 48 weeks, patients who completed period one were randomized and equally allocated to one of the three TEV-‘749 treatment groups. The end-of-treatment and follow-up visits will be at 4 and 8 weeks after administration of the last treatment dose, respectively. The primary objective of the Phase 3 SOLARIS study was to evaluate the efficacy of TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia. A key secondary objective was to further evaluate the efficacy of TEV-‘749 based on additional parameters in adult patients with schizophrenia. A secondary objective that is still ongoing through period two of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia.

"# Abstract

>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability. Sequelae can include functional impairments and psychiatric syndromes such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. Special Operations Forces (SOF) veterans (SOVs) may be at an elevated risk for these complications, leading some to seek underexplored treatment alternatives such as the oneirogen ibogaine, a plant-derived compound known to interact with multiple neurotransmitter systems that has been studied primarily as a treatment for substance use disorders. Ibogaine has been associated with instances of fatal cardiac arrhythmia, but coadministration of magnesium may mitigate this concern. In the present study, we report a prospective observational study of the Magnesium–Ibogaine: the Stanford Traumatic Injury to the CNS protocol (MISTIC), provided together with complementary treatment modalities, in 30 male SOVs with predominantly mild TBI. We assessed changes in the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule from baseline to immediately (primary outcome) and 1 month (secondary outcome) after treatment. Additional secondary outcomes included changes in PTSD (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5), depression (Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) and anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale). MISTIC resulted in significant improvements in functioning both immediately (*P*corrected < 0.001, Cohen’s *d* = 0.74) and 1 month (*P*corrected < 0.001, *d* = 2.20) after treatment and in PTSD (*P*corrected < 0.001, *d* = 2.54), depression (*P*corrected < 0.001, *d* = 2.80) and anxiety (*P*corrected < 0.001, *d* = 2.13) at 1 month after treatment. There were no unexpected or serious adverse events. Controlled clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy are needed to validate these initial open-label findings.

"# AC-262 vs Ostarine

**Comparing AC-262 vs. Ostarine: Understanding Research Chemicals**

In the realm of fitness and bodybuilding, the quest for effective supplements to enhance performance and build muscle is ongoing. Two research chemicals that have garnered attention in this regard are AC-262 and Ostarine. Both are categorized as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), compounds that target specific androgen receptors in the body. Let's delve into a comparative analysis of these two compounds.

### AC-262:

AC-262 is a relatively new player in the world of SARMs. It is an orally active compound designed to mimic the effects of testosterone without the androgenic side effects associated with traditional anabolic steroids. Developed primarily for its potential in increasing muscle mass and strength, AC-262 works by binding to androgen receptors in muscle and bone tissues, thereby promoting muscle growth and bone density.

[Science Bio AC-262](https://preview.redd.it/g67mwsiio5zc1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df295fb088345f6b32c796995234748d6d033341)

### Ostarine:

Ostarine, also known as MK-2866, is one of the most well-known and researched SARMs. It has gained popularity for its ability to enhance lean muscle mass and strength while minimizing unwanted side effects. Ostarine works by selectively binding to androgen receptors in muscle and bone tissues, similar to AC-262. However, it is also known for its potential therapeutic applications in conditions such as muscle wasting diseases and osteoporosis.

### Comparative Analysis:

**1. Efficacy:**

* Ostarine has been extensively studied in both animal and human trials, demonstrating significant improvements in lean muscle mass and strength.
* AC-262, being a newer compound, lacks the same depth of research and clinical trials. Therefore, its efficacy compared to Ostarine is not as well-established.

**2. Side Effects:**

* Ostarine is generally well-tolerated at recommended doses, with minimal androgenic side effects such as suppression of natural testosterone production.
* The side effect profile of AC-262 is not yet fully understood due to limited research. However, being a SARM, it is presumed to have a similar side effect profile to Ostarine.

**3. Legal Status:**

* Ostarine has been subject to regulatory scrutiny due to its potential for misuse in sports and bodybuilding. It is banned by many sports organizations and regulatory bodies.
* AC-262's legal status may vary depending on regional regulations and its classification as a research chemical.

**4. Availability:**

* Ostarine is more readily available from various suppliers and is marketed for research purposes.
* AC-262 may have limited availability due to its newer status and lesser-known reputation.

### Conclusion:

In the comparison between AC-262 and Ostarine, Ostarine emerges as the more established and researched option. Its efficacy and safety profile have been relatively well-documented, making it a popular choice among athletes and fitness enthusiasts. On the other hand, AC-262 shows promise but lacks the same level of research and regulatory approval as Ostarine. As with any research chemical, caution should be exercised, and individuals should consult with healthcare professionals before use. Additionally, it's essential to adhere to legal regulations regarding the purchase and use of these compounds. Disclaimer: Not For Human Consumption."
"Recently there was a chain/post about surgical procedures for hysterectomy. I am 6 months PO a Da Vinci Robotic full RADICAL hysterectomy. It took everything & then some. Saved my life!!! Decades of endometriosis. I did years of clinical trials for Neurocrine Bioscience (Abbvie) to give the world Elagolix. You're welcome. 

When I recently posted about my DaVinci hysterectomy, it was met with futility & causticness. As a 3 time sexual assault survivor, I  am not ""Namby Pamby"" to ways of the world. Having ensured all I have, I choose to be a Victor rather than a victim.

In the DaVinci Robotic Hysterectomy procedure, ask:  your state of dress/undress. Ask who is in the room. Ask how long the procedure takes. ASK how your body is positioned throughout surgery.

When I posted my experience a few days ago, SHIT HIT THE FAN! OMG!!! It was TMI overload. I never want to hurt anyone 💔.  I've got anxiety myself. I deleted my posts, at rhe risks of being TMI to ladies that hadn't had their surgery.  

But here I am. Grammy... 57, 3 endometriosis surgeries. And finally, a move to a new state & an INCREDIBLE doctor (Beautiful Doc Kelle O.) - who saved me frickin life! 🍀  Slante!

I'm here, open to share to the thicked skinned. For Ye will surely survive & be loved, as I have been."

"I'm currently working as a scribe for a radiation oncologist at an eminent research-focused cancer center. The radiation oncologist I document for leads research on a number of ongoing clinical trials. I'm wondering if the work I do scribing for him would fall under ""research experience."" 

My involvement, for added context:

- I document the discussions he has with his patients about the logistics of the trials, the process of determining their candidacy, and their decision about signing consent.

- I complete pre-charting (chart review, adding new oncologic history items, diagnostics, procedures, etc.) for all of his patients.

- I fill out the documentation on clinic day (HPI/Interval History, Physical Exam, Assessment/Plan) for all of his patients.

- If there are any deviations from the clinical trial protocol, I document those.

Obviously I won't get to have my name published under author or anything fancy like that, but does my contribution seem meaningful enough to classify as a research experience? 

Thanks! (:"
"I've been on the stuff for a few years. If you're someone new to it, or looking at getting it, I'll share with you the words of advice my sleep specialist gave to me- sugar free lemonade. 

Mio drops (generic is fine). Lemonade hides it the best, orange is okay. Can't taste it at all (and I'm at 4.5g, twice a night). The powdered stuff works okay, but that's a PITA because you've gotta have a pitcher in your bedroom to bathroom and that's just inconvenient. 

Yes. It affects the meds. The acid in the lemonade does the exact same thing to the oxybate that your stomach acid would also instantly do; it converts it from the oxybate form to the active form- GHB. It doesn't alter efficacy. It doesn't alter absorption. It just hides the taste. The reason it specifically states to use water is because that is what was used in clinical trials. That's all they're allowed to say to take it with. If it had been trialed using Jolt cola as a mixer, then that's what your script would say. They use water in clinical trials to get approval for meds to rule out that something else was causing the observed effects being claimed by the medication. It's perfectly safe to do. (And I can actually honestly say 'trust me, I'm a scientist'- Im a former plant biologist, who also used to work in dairy QC, cannabis, pharmaceuticals, semiconductor R&D, industrial water purification, industrial haz waste, and now battery R&D; a multidisciplinary researcher). 


And do not, for any reason, use root beer. It doesn't conceal anything and simply tastes like you're drinking root beer flavored salt water. In fact, that's true with pretty much all soda. 

She suggested the sugar free lemonade to me the day I first got my script. It makes the stuff actually palatable. Plus, all that citric acid will help prevent calcium oxalate kidney stones from forming; something the high sodium levels in oxybate help to encourage TO form. It's a win win. "

"Recent studies have suggested that long COVID may be caused by a prolonged, subclinical infection leading to the establishment of a viral reservoir, potentially in the gut,23 that can modulate host immune responses and contribute to persistent cognitive symptoms.24-26

Surgery in such patients could result in unintentional spread of the SARS-CoV-2 viral reservoir to distal tissues such as the lung, where infection can cause severe damage.27 Autoantibody responses directed against central nervous system antigens, including myelin and G-protein-coupled receptors, also are detectable in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and strongly correlate with abnormal cognitive status in long COVID patients.28 Surgery in patients with already elevated autoantibody levels may induce further autoimmunity due to tissue damage leading to epitope spreading.29

Finally, defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and lipid catabolism have been linked with cognitive and noncognitive symptoms of long COVID,30,31 and surgery in long COVID patients with mitochondrial dysfunction may prolong the recovery phase. Further studies are needed to determine if the prevalence of these various biomarkers is reflective of underlying disease processes or of preexisting long COVID both before and after surgery.

Mitigating the Impact of Long COVID on Surgery
Though cognitive symptoms caused by long COVID may be difficult to diagnose, there are strategies to help surgeons identify biomarkers of import. For example, clinical diagnostic testing can be used to identify long COVID patients who may have a persistent infection. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx, it may be important to test for viral RNA or protein present in stool samples from long COVID patients before elective surgery, as the gut may be a cryptic viral reservoir.

One possible intervention for patients suspected of having a persistent infection may be to administer nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) as preoperative prophylaxis to help clear infection. There is some evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may help alleviate long COVID symptoms as well,26 and it is currently being tested as a treatment for long COVID in clinical trials.32

Another option for surgeons when confronted with patients at risk for postoperative delirium who also may have long COVID is to refer them to a long COVID clinic for evaluation. Not only can their baseline cognitive status be determined, but further testing—if needed—can be suggested during this evaluation. There are multiple long COVID clinics that are associated with large academic medical centers as well as community hospitals located throughout the US.33 Many offer televisits for patients who are not local. Long COVID clinics offer consultation across multiple specialties of internal medicine, and therefore, could be used to assess the status of long COVID patients with both cognitive and noncognitive symptoms. These are just two examples of how surgeons might consider modifying their care plans for patients with long COVID who also are at risk for postoperative delirium. Much work remains to be done before the root causes of long COVID-related cognitive dysfunction can be determined and effective treatments developed.

Given that the number of adults with long COVID who are experiencing prolonged though often subtle and nuanced cognitive changes, is growing and that surgical intervention can adversely affect long-term cognition, it remains unknown how this syndrome will affect the health outcomes of surgical patients."

My sister was diagnosed on April 11. Her tumour has grown in the couple of weeks since. Currently 4cm with  >10cm DOI. She has been included in a clinical trial (Neoadjuvant Immunoradiotherapy) and they are trying to start radiation Monday. 
They do the radiation first and there is some back and forth about whether it’s crossed the midline of the tongue. They are hoping the radiation shrinks it back so they only have to take that side (left side). 

She currently has a PEG tube as she was having issues with swallowing and she is in a lot of pain. 

I’m looking to see if anyone else has been diagnosed like this and how are you/they doing?  I’m just so worried about her. I could write a novel but I am just looking for some reality of what is ahead of us. "

"One of the 5 [race and ethnicity categories](https://www.reddit.com/r/RegulatoryClinWriting/comments/1aebxch/fdas_updated_draft_guidance_on_collection_of_race/) included in the FDA 2024 guidance, and required for reporting clinical trial data is “Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.”

May is Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA, NHPI) Heritage month and part of focus on AA, NHPI Heritage, Dr. Christine Lee of FDA Office of Minority Health and Health Equity [talked to Drs. Todd Seto and Deborah Taira about the work they do with the Hawaii Health Equity Research and Outreach Network](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-equity-forum-podcast/engaging-native-hawaiian-communities-clinical-trials) (Hawaii HERON) addressing health disparities in this community.

**Paradox**

According to the Commonwealth Fund's [2022 report](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/scorecard/2022/jun/2022-scorecard-state-health-system-performance), Hawaii along with Massachusetts has the best healthcare in the US. These two states’ overall performance separates them from other states and they have much better outcomes than the next, third state on the list, Connecticut. Hawaii has the highest life expectancy of any state in the US. The Hawaii HERON researchers, however, [found that the healthcare access is uneven and disparities exist](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-equity-forum-podcast/engaging-native-hawaiian-communities-clinical-trials), for example, Native Hawaiians live about 11 years less than Chinese in Hawaii. Native Hawaiians were often not on optimal medications or had best practice devices or other therapies. The health disparities for Pacific Islander patients was even worse. In one survey, they found many Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander patients with diabetes in a hospital, but no white patients.

**Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (Race/Ethnicity FDA Data Reporting Category)**

Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander category includes a diverse group of people.

* Native Hawaiians: most of them are born in the US, speak English, are aware of clinical trials
* Pacific Islander: in Hawaii, many Pacific Islander people are from islands throughout the Pacific, American Samoa, Western Samoa, Guam, Chuuk, Pompeii, Fiji -- together from many different islands, with different cultures, history (including wars), experiences, languages, immigrant experiences. These indigenous populations, in their own right, have different view of their relationship with the U.S. For many, English is *not* the first language and many would not have heard about clinical trial (when first asked, they are likely to confuse it with ""criminal trial"").

**Hawaii HERON's Work -- Addressing Barriers to Clinical Trial Participation**

One way to address health disparity is to make sure that all communities have access to clinical trial information and infrastructure. And, Hawaii HERON is supporting initiatives such as  expansion of culturally and linguistically tailored health education.

HERON's work, identifies **barriers** to clinical trails and suggests **strategies to increase engagement and enrollment** of Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander people in clinical trials:

* Develop *culturally appropriate* clinical and health literature and engagement strategies, i.e., develop ""stories"" (since their is storytelling tradition) and have these being told by other patients in the community. Culturally appropriate interaction also means spending time with people, not rushed, answering questions and being respectful.
* Availability is an issue: "" '*Have you ever been asked to be in a clinical trial?'* *And we found with the white patients, they had all had some experience, or almost all of them had some experience of at least being asked, or knowing somebody that was in a trial. But the vast majority of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander patients said they were never asked to be in a tria*l.""
* Trust is an issue -- just offering participation in trial is not enough, there has to be a culture of ""accepting"" in the community that clinical trials do more good than harm. For that,

>Work with people *embedded* in community: People trust their primary care physicians and health providers who are from the same community. Creating mentorship and training programs. When asked,  ""Do you trust your doctor to do what's best for your health?"" 85% of them said yes.

* Expand *data availability*: Clinical data on Native Hawaiians and, in particular, Pacific Islanders is sparse, since these communities are often lumped with Asians as ""Other"". Asian Americans have the longest life expectancy and very different issues. Less data on Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders means *invisibility* and perpetuation of disparities.

**Postscript**

HERON researchers ended the podcast with ""*The main finding, which is both surprising and not surprising, is how interested and eager the patients that we saw, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander patients, were to enroll or engage in clinical trials.*""

**Why Medical Writers Should Care**

HERON's work is informative for developing FDA's Diversity Plan for Clinical Trials.

"I know y'all like shouty AI-generated DD full of bad analogies, but let's try something different.

ProKidney (PROK) is a pharma company that is developing a new cell therapy treatment for chronic kidney disease called REACT. About 30M Americans have kidney disease, and about .8M live with kidney failure, so it's very common and there is a lot of money in treatment - just look at the 12b market cap of DVA, a dialysis company.

PROK has made it through Phase 2  and is preparing to start Phase 3 of clinical trials BUT their manufacturing is on pause right now due to an audit of its quality management. They have brought in some new executives and are working on expanding operations over the next few years and opening new facilities in NC with the support of Greensboro and Winston-Salem. They say they have enough capital to survive through the end of the 2025, but plan on start manufacturing again ""mid 2024"".

**Bear Case**

The bear case is pretty straightforward: they are not able to start manufacturing again OR they start manufacturing again but the Phase 3 results disappoint. This is certainly a possibility and a big risk. There is not a lot of news that comes out about the company and it's hard to tell if they are on schedule. There is a real danger they could burn through their cash and go BK.

**Bull Case**

The short-term bull case is that they start manufacturing again in the next few months. This positive news could be a catalyst that brings buyers. A longer-term bull case is that they not only fix their quality issues and start manufacturing again, but also have positive Stage 3 results. This could 5-10x in the next 2 years if things go right.

**Price**

About a month ago, the price shot up on no news. I think this got picked up by some short screener algos and some pharma tracking sites. However, I don't think this is any kind of squeeze play so I don't even want to speak to short interest. The play here is primarily that positive news comes out in the next few months.

Also, it's worth noting that the options for this ticker are not very liquid. There is at least an option chain so you can try to grab contracts, but don't bid-ask spreads are huge and you won't move anything quickly.

**Disclosure**

I am long PROK. I am holding shares, $2.50 5/17 calls, and $2.50 6/21 calls. I plan on rolling those contracts forward until there is some news. I see this as a true bet with high risk and high upside.

\--

tldr: PROK is a pharma company on a manufacturing pause and may either go under or see a big upside if they can start up production again."
"I’m not sure what to do or how to be a good friend without jeopardizing my own wellbeing. 

I have been friends with Jane since middle school. We both have families with young children. She has a baby as well. For the past year and a half Jane has had a mysterious illness. It has turned her life upside down. 

I haven’t been able to see her because it’s possibly contagious, but we’d still occasionally talk on the phone or text. I’d send food. I’ve also had some poor health and was recently misdiagnosed. So, we would commiserate together. 

Because she’s so contagious, Jane had to move out of her house and in with her parents away from her children. Her parents eventually kicked her out because they’re older and were starting to catch her disease. She’s now living with her BIL in his attic. 

She can barely go out. She’s going stir crazy and is spiraling down into a dark place. The doctors can’t seem to help her and some have even said she was crazy. She’s been doing A LOT of internet research and she found something that said researchers are doing clinical trials with a medication that is helping people with the disease like hers - but it’s for animals. 

She has asked a lot of her friends if they can get her this medication. One said she would but changed her mind. Another said she would, but then “can’t remember” to send it. 

She called me today, crying. Saying she couldn’t live like this. She couldn’t go another day without being with her children. Her baby was already forgetting her. Her milk dried up. 

She knows I play fast and loose with the rules. She begged me to get her the medication. She said she would kill herself if she didn’t get it. It’s the only thing giving her hope. 

I said I would get it for her and I did, but I don’t think I can actually give it to her. I looked up some of the side effects. It’s super rare, but it has been known to kill animals. 

What do I do? What if I give it to her and she dies? But if I don’t give it to her and she kills herself, that’s my fault too. She’s my best friend. I don’t want her to hate me forever, but I don’t want to be responsible if something bad happens to her. If it gets traced back to me, is that manslaughter? Should I call her husband? Should I tell him she’s suicidal? Is that breaking her trust? 

What should I do?

"Hi!

Hope you guys have been well!

I discussed this topic with my neurologist, but I wanted to know if anyone here has been part of this clinical trial. 

How was your experience? Side effects?

I ve been told not try and have kids during the trial, so this is making me think. Just in general, what the impact could be.

Also looking for advice in general on clinical trials. 

Thx!"

**Barred From Each Other: Why Normative Husbands Remain Married to Incarcerated Wives—An Exploratory Study – page 2**

You’ve got to understand, what we’re talking about here is great love. That’s the whole story. The idea of leaving her never came up. It was never mentioned or discussed. Our romantic life could never be dismantled just because one of us did something wrong. Separation is totally irrelevant. \[After exposing her crime\] I never felt as if I don’t love her or want her less. It’s all a matter of pure commitment—built on pure love—and this is something you do not abandon. (A., 53)

I decided to stay with her for two reasons: great love and great commitment. I swear that \[after her incarceration\] it never crossed my mind to leave her. I’m with her until the end. Our love is priceless. I don’t care for other women; I’m just waiting for her. I always knew from the second I met her that we will be together until death. I will not desert her regardless of the situation. She is the best thing that ever happened to me. (D., 34)

I told myself, you’re not going to leave her no matter what happens. We’ve been together since we’re 17, we love each other a lot and we’re committed to each other. Let it be clear—I decided to stay with her just because of us, and not because of the kids and the house. I love her very much. She is the love of my life and my best friend and I’m staying with her no matter what happens. (S., a 53-year-old Jewish husband, married to an inmate sentenced to a period of 27 months in prison, continues in the same vein.

Interestingly, in addition to the decisive description of all research participants of their marriage in terms of love and devotion, six participants related to these relations and their spouses in adorable and admirable ways. These participants perceive their women partners as being unique and exceptional, each a veritable femme fatale, and describe the relations with them in various flattering and admirable ways.

She is everything to me. When I look to the right—I see her. When I look to the left—I see

her. I see her and no one else but her. I admire her. She is pure gold. There is no one like her

in the world and that’s why our love is so strong. (Y., a 60-year-old Jewish husband, married

to a first-timer sentenced to 4 years)

And this sentiment is echoed in two other statements:

I admire my wife. She is bigger than life itself. I can only thank God that she’s mine/that I have her. (S., 53)

She is a very special woman and a friend. She is special, not like any other woman. (A., 53)

While these quotations illustrate the high appreciation and admiration of the women spouses, the next ones portray the specific personal characteristics that make the women so admirable:

She is the most clever, intelligent, and lovely woman in the world. She is energetic, active, and dominant. An amazing woman. (T., 52

She is a good soul. She is warm and emphatic, \[mentally\] stronger than any man I know, very reliable. She has so many virtues: understandable, intelligent, supportive, funny, and very ethical. (D., 34)

She is \[mentally\] a very strong woman. She is remarkable . . . outstanding. She knows everything—regardless of the fact that she’s in prison. (Z., 55)

She is a good human-being: She takes care of everyone . . . pays attention to everyone . . . she loves to help people. (A., 53

All the participants love and admire their partners and perceive them as an attached and inherent part of their past, present, and future married lives. These statements clearly demonstrate that love is perceived as an essential component for the preservation of good marital relations—in general and in times of crisis. Moreover, regardless of female-spouses’ criminal conduct and imprisonment, most partners describe them as ideal and wonderful women, using words of admiration. As such, continuation of the marriage to them may be perceived as an obvious and rational act.

**Perception of Wife’s Criminal Conduct**

Numerous studies have argued that most female inmates are abandoned by their male counterparts, be it because of the forced disengagement and/or the shame in their “betrayal” of the law, their families, and their “traditional gender roles” (McGowan & Blumenthal, 1978; Stanton, 1980). Evidently, such desertion is solely dependent on men’s discretion, irrespective of the female inmates’ desires (Dodge & Pogrebin, 2001; Pelka-Slugocka & Slugocki, 1980).

Somewhat in contrast to these studies, our findings indicate that although all participants acknowledge that their spouses committed various criminal offenses and morally reject it, they do not perceive them and their criminal conduct as shameful and disgraceful. Specifically, the participants (deliberately or unintentionally) describe their spouses’ criminal behaviors in a forgiving manner, explaining it as a “sad tale” (i.e., an outcome of harsh and complicated life-story; Scott & Lyman, 1968). By doing so, they invalidate the female inmates’ moral and criminal responsibilities, detach their criminal conduct from their character, and defend their dignity and importance:

My wife did not do all these things. She meant to do no bad. I know that she doesn’t act out of evilness . . . she is a good person . . . a victim of herself. She didn’t really want to kill me . . . It is not her fault . . . her friends are bad . . . they pushed her to act this way. I can’t believe and I don’t believe that she did what she did independently. (A., 53)

They \[the police\] found some financial inconsistencies in the bank and instead of exposing the truth and framing her brother, she took responsibility. I knew she did everything in order to save her brother. She is a good soul and her family members abused her. All she did was done in order to protect her family and not because she’s bad. She is a good soul . . . a queen who made a mistake in order to save her brother. (S., 53)

She did not take it \[the money\] for herself . . . She gave it to her family. She has a big family and someone had to take care of them. Looking back, I think she had no choice. (I., 47)

Six participants use neutralization techniques (Sykes & Matza, 1957) to support their contention of their partners’ morality. The men resort to “denial of injury” and “denial of responsibility.” In their simplest form, the former technique suggests that this was a no-victim crime and the latter proposes that the criminal actions were caused by forces beyond the perpetrator’s control (Enticott, 2011).

After all, what did she do? What crime had she committed? It’s not that she enjoyed the money. It’s not that she is walking around wearing lots of jewelry. She’s a modest individual and all in all she did not take big sums of money. Maybe they \[justice system\] can define her as an offender, but for me she is P., my beloved wife, and that’s that. (C., 37)

n fact, what did she do? She got involved with the gray market, something that could happen to anyone, and they forced her to do what she did. It could happen to me, to you, to anyone. She made a mistake but she is only human. But it’s not a crime and she’s not a criminal. (Z., 55)

No! My wife is not a criminal. She didn’t break the law. In my opinion, all she did was make a single mistake. The fact that she’s in prison does not make her a criminal. (I., 47)

**Difficulties in Marital Relationships With Incarcerated Wife**

Numerous studies have repeatedly argued that three factors underlie most crises in marital relationships: diminished (or extinguished) love, reduced (or lack of) intimacy, and weakened (or nonexistent) commitment (Mace, 1982; Sabatelli & Cecil-Pigo, 1985; Sharlin, 1996; Sokolski & Hendrick, 1999; Surra et al., 1988). Our findings deviate somewhat and indicate that regardless of lengths of imprisonment and/or marriage, the major difficulty experienced by most (n = 7) participants relates to lack of physical intimacy. All other inconveniences and difficulties characterizing marital relationships in crisis (Huston, Caughlin, Houts, Smith, & George, 2001) appear to be irrelevant to the interviewees:

During the last six months \[time of spouse’s incarceration\] everything has obviously changed, because of her physical absence. We meet once a month \[conjugal visits\] and it is not enough. I miss the physical intimacy, the physical togetherness. I miss it. It is difficult. I currently and practically live with no romantic relationships. I miss her body and her smell.

(I., 47)

I miss her smell. She has amazing smells, nothing I experienced with other women. I miss having sex with her. I miss being hugged by her, feeling her head on my shoulder. (D., 34)

\[You can’t believe\] how much I miss her. I miss her hugs, I miss the physical contact with her, I miss going to sleep with her. (T., 52)

An additional difficulty, raised by six (75%) participants, relates to lack of support by family members, friends, and acquaintances. In some cases, participants report that people totally ignored or terminated relationships after the incarceration. The participants view this kind of behavior as an outcome of shame and/or disappointment:

It wasn’t easy with my family \[because\] they wanted me to divorce her. They didn’t understand how she could do that and didn’t accept her. They were really furious. They decided to break off relations with her. My reaction, by the way, was to completely break off my relations with my family. (Z., 55)

Some family members and all my neighbors told me that I should be ashamed of my wife. In school, my children suffered daily harassments from other children, from the teachers, and even from the headmaster. All of them wanted us to forget her as if she were dead. They think she should be “dead” . . . deleted! (S., 53)

Two very close friends of ours were informed \[by us\] about the trial and the offense. It was very embarrassing. Yet, their reaction was even more embarrassing and made us want to bury ourselves deep in the ground: In the most difficult moment of our life, they deserted us. They had a very dramatic discussion with my wife on the phone with lots of shouting and yelling and then, decided to stop talking to us. These people are not human-beings. You cannot call them friends. (Y., 60)

None of her friends called or asked us how we feel. None of our friends came to visit her in prison. Is this friendship? This is disgusting. It’s very difficult to live with the notion that suddenly, when you are in trouble, everyone disappears. Suddenly, no-one wishes to be your friend. (A., 53)

**Preconditions for the Continuation of Marital Relationships Between Normative Men and Incarcerated Wives**

All research participants have pointed out two central factors that could have had a negative effect on the marriage, perhaps even leading to their termination of this relationship: (a) length of prison sentence and (b) length of marriage prior to the imprisonment.

Length of prison sentence. Most (n = 7) participants assert that because their spouses were sentenced to relatively short terms of imprisonment, they did not consider leaving them. However, they also state that if the sentence had been longer, they may have considered terminating the marriage and finding a new relationship:

I don’t know what would have happened to our romantic relationships if she’d been imprisoned for, let’s say, 20 years. I believe I would have separated from her. It’s like disappearing from someone’s life for a very long time. Time is definitely a significant factor.

(I., 47)

On the day of the verdict, when the judge said “4 years,” I felt as if my hands were freezing. If it were 10 or 15 years, then I’d probably acted differently. I doubt if I would have stayed with her . . . with all due respect to love. (Z., 55)

These findings strengthen previous findings (Holt & Miller, 1972; Walker, 1983) revealing a decline in visiting patterns among wives of long-term prisoners compared with wives of short-termers, as well as deterioration of marriages over long periods of incarceration.

I had a very dramatic discussion with my wife on the phone with lots of shouting and yelling and then, decided to stop talking to us. These people are not human-beings. You cannot call them friends. (Y., 60)

None of her friends called or asked us how we feel. None of our friends came to visit her in

prison. Is this friendship? This is disgusting. It’s very difficult to live with the notion that

suddenly, when you are in trouble, everyone disappears. Suddenly, no-one wishes to be your

friend. (A., 53)

**Preconditions for the Continuation of Marital Relationships Between Normative Men and Incarcerated Wives**

These findings strengthen previous findings (Holt & Miller, 1972; Walker, 1983) revealing a decline in visiting patterns among wives of long-term prisoners compared with wives of short-termers, as well as deterioration of marriages over long periods of incarceration.

**Length of marriage prior to incarceration**. 

The men’s decision to remain married was determined, to a significant degree, to the duration of the relationship prior to the woman’s incarceration. Our findings show that all participants perceive the total length of the relationship prior to spouses’ incarceration to be positively correlated to their decision to remain married:

If we’d been married for a year and then she’d begun committing crimes, I would have separated from her. But now, after so many years of marriage, there is no way I would leave her. The length of our romantic relationships is a critical factor. That’s why I couldn’t see any option of leaving her. (I., 47)

Please don’t forget that I didn’t meet her yesterday, we’ve been together for almost 10 years. We went through many things together. It’s a lot of time and obviously, I won’t leave her. (D., 34

**Ways of Preserving the Marital Relationships With Incarcerated Wives**

All participants (N = 8) report that to deal with their pain of separation and maintain marital relationships, they use two tactics—frequent phone calls and making all visits

that the prison allows.

The men receive four or five phone calls a day from their imprisoned partners. Both partners await these phone calls and cherish them, as the frequent and continuous delivery and receipt of information create a semblance of the exchange of information that occurs when living under the same roof. Symbolically, the ongoing communication, and hearing the partner’s voice, signifies a continuation of everyday \[dyadic and nondyadic\] normal life:

We constantly maintain telephone contact. I’m like a child, again and again waiting for her phone calls. It doesn’t matter whether I am with friends, at work, or at a restaurant, I wait for her to call me all the time. She calls me three times a day, in the morning, noon, and in the evening hours. (T., 52)

We talk on the phone all day and every day. We actually do everything through the phone: We talk about her feelings, what happened to her in prison during the day, what happened to me at work, and how we miss each other. That’s basically it. (D., 34)

I love it when she calls me. I look forward to her phone calls. That’s how I really know what is going on with her in prison. (S., 53)

The second tactic is routinely coming for the bi-weekly 30-min visits to which all prisoners are entitled, whether or not they are also allowed home furloughs (IPS, 2012). The visits take place on Saturdays and Sundays, and all families gather in a relatively small, closed, and sealed space. There are open visits in which the inmate can be in physical touch with the visitors and closed visits, conducted through an armored-glass division. All participants welcome the visits, perceive them as the best temporary way of realizing their marriage, and look forward to them:

I visit her every two weeks. Up to now, I haven’t missed a single visit. We were limited to 30 minute in-person visits every two weeks during her first year. After that they let us have a 12 hour conjugal visit each month. Now she can come home \[on furlough\] for 24 hours every month. That time of being together in the home refreshes our love. In addition, we talk on the phone four times a day. I wait for these calls because I love talking to her. We talk about her day, about my day, about things that happened to both of us at work, about intimate thoughts. (A., 53)

I visit her every two weeks, sometimes with her parents and sometimes alone. We sit together, talk, laugh, and try to make use of our \[joint\] time. (Y., 60)

I come to visit her every two weeks. I never missed a single visit. Occasionally, I bring our son with me. We wake up at 5 in the morning and drive 4 hours just to see her for 30 minutes. And then we have to drive 4 hours back. But I wouldn’t have missed it for the world. (C., 37)

**Discussion**

Incarceration affects all aspects of family life, including the health and well-being of inmates’ spouses and children, and the maintenance of family attachments. It can also lead to marital dissolution (Comfort, 2007; Goffman, 2009; Lopoo & Western, 2005; Western & Wildeman, 2009). Most studies concerning the impact of imprisonment on inmates’ marriages have focused on the effects of men’s incarceration (Chui, 2010; Wildeman, Schnittker, & Turney, 2012), whereas only scarce attention directed at the effects of women’s incarceration on their families. This appears to be quiet odd \[and disturbing\] in light of research findings showing that most incarcerations of men rarely result in marital breakup (Dodge & Pogrebin, 2001; Travis et al., 2003), whereas most women sentenced to prison are abandoned by their partners and their pre-incarceration romantic relations are terminated (Hairston & Addams, 2001; Sergin & Flora, 2005).

The current study provides important information about the characteristics, motivation, and justifications of men to preserve marital relationships with their imprisoned spouses. Out of 180 prisoners incarcerated in the single Israeli female incarceration facility, Neve Tirza Prison, only nine (of whom eight took part in the study) maintain stable marital relationships longer than 3 years. All these inmates except one, who was sentenced to 264 months, had no criminal records prior to current imprisonment, and were only sentenced to a relatively short time of incarceration (M = 21.8 months). Interestingly, all spouses (but one) have no prior criminal record and therefore can be considered normative (i.e., law-abiding).

The interviews yielded five overarching themes: (a) perceptions of marital relations with incarcerated spouse, (b) perceptions of wife’s criminal conduct, (c) difficulties in marital relationships with incarcerated spouse, (d) preconditions for the continuation of marital relationships between normative men and incarcerated wives, (e) and ways of preserving the marital relationships with incarcerated partners

The discovery that the wife had committed a crime, the following arrest, initial stages of incarceration, and mainly the concealment of the crime from family and community members are experienced as stressful crises. Yet, participants describe incarceration as a challenge that brought the couple even closer, enhancing mutual responsibility and commitment.

This study elucidates the shock and devastation that comes with the discovery that one’s wife had committed a crime, and then with the following arrest and the initial stages of incarceration. The psychosocial effects of finding out about the crime linger well beyond the time of initial shock. Thus, although four (50%) of the participants were interviewed 2 years or more after they had first learned of their wives’ criminal actions, they still referred to the great difficulty of discovery and its long-lasting negative impact. Specifically, all participants testified that the incarceration of their female partners raised frustrations, tension, and lack of trust that led them to reconsider their motivation to preserve their marriages. They clearly described the disruption the revelation caused and the resulting strain on their marital relationship.

Although the romantic relationship was undoubtedly stressed by the discovery of the crime, the arrest, and the incarceration, all participants seemed to have had the resources to meet this challenge or found appropriate support to do so. Our findings indicate that the incarceration led the husbands to recognize their obligation to their partners and to their relationship. Similarly, clinical experience and several empirical studies suggest that some couples facing hospitalization, critical illness, or serious injuries perceive their marital relationship to be improved since the medical episode (e. g., Dorval et al., 2005). The trauma often creates a powerful intensified family bond and feeling of mutual empathy (Eggenberger & Nelms, 2007) and intensifies the desire to protect each other (Burr, 1998). Whether this kind of interaction may stabilize and strengthen a relationship after arrest is to be determined in future research. "

"TL;DR  
19yo, in UCD studying Computer Science. In my 2nd year of college however in 1st year remediating my failed modules from last year. On ritalin (40mg a day, 20mg morning and afternoon). Works occasionally for me doing college work (However work is sloppy/in-efficient despite my perfectionism demanding hours for 1 question). Not in HSE catchment area. HSE said they would give me a trial treatment of Strattera in 2 months. Feeling down and desperate in regards to college as my exams approach so would like advice as well as experience reports on Strattera in comparison to Ritalin or other medications.

19yo. Currently struggling through my 2nd year of college (in 1st year again to remediate failed modules) (Computer Science in UCD for those curious).  
Was prescribed Ritalin (IR, 2x 10mg tabs morning and afternoon) as a trial treatment through the college psychiatrist while also currently seeing my local HSE clinic. I come from a pretty traditional family that is semi lower class so I don't have funds for private assessment (Let alone support) (I'm also incapable of saving money so that avenue is unlikely.)  
Suspecting that I have AuDHD as pointed out by my counselor in college which is how this entire journey started for me.

Ritalin for me has been a hit or miss. I feel the typical side effects you'd normally see but as for the effects you want to see? Eh? Sometimes I would zone in on my work for hours at a time but my perfectionism would end up making me take hours on just 1 singular question let alone even 1 assignment (Still end up with a subpar result anyway. Maybe I just can't learn). But most of the time, I would just feel a stronger urge of wanting to do my college work but not actually having the ability to start on it (Feeds into depressive symptoms and anxiety unfortunately).  
Never ever seen it work in regards to my attention in lectures and I get more easily distracted.

Where I live doesn't fit in any catchment areas (Kildare) so the HSE has been bouncing me back and forward with ""Oh we don't have the services"" however they did end up saying they will try prescribing me with Strattera as a trial treatment in 2 months time once I get my ECG and bloods.  
Some friends of mine have just said things along the lines of ""its basically just a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, its what they give you if they dont wanna give you proper meds"" so I'm curious as to what experience you've all experience in regards to it? Compared to Ritalin or any other medication.

Or any general advice in regards to ADHD treatment/assessment or advice for someone barely or not even scraping by college would be nice. Apologies for the tiresome walls of text, have been feeling really down because of my performance in college with my end of semester exams approaching. If I'm missing any crucial info let me know and sorry if the rambling seems incoherent.

Spoiler below is of my time in college and pre-college in case there's details that seem important.

>!Never ever done cold hard study in my entire life. Mostly just involves an hour or 2 of glancing over notes, doing repeated questions or staring at question solutions. Academically was excelling (not in languages) due to the rote learning in schools so I had high expectations placed by my family. Got 550+ points in my L.C despite 0 study which I covered up with a facade. Went into college and had a troubling first 2 months and was suggested by a class rep to explore the counseling services on campus. Then decided to explore the GP on campus as well and was prescribed anti-depressants (Setraline and Escitalopram) none of which worked. Counselor then brought up autism and suggested I contact the college psychiatrist. Went and was given the symptom sheets to fill. Brought up concerns about ADHD and was brushed off as he doesn't diagnose it for reasons. GP referred me to the HSE by this point and the first HSE appointment went along the lines of ""An ADHD service is in the works. Expected to be available by next summer"" however my specific catchment doesn't have services so I was bounced around with appointments. (Till this day the services hasn't made progress still in my area at least) Continued to see the psychiatrist and counselor for another year until psychiatrist decided to try prozac for depression. Killed my anxiety but had absolute horrible side effects as a result which almost turned me into a walking zombie (Had 0% attendance and grades) so stopped taking them. Brought up ADHD again but this time asking if it's possible to see any options that are available out of the country, decided to put me on trial for ritalin. College performance by now was sufficient enough, barely scraping passes (D- grades)!<"

The company, known for its innovative approach to developing targeted therapies for serious oncological conditions, has not only shown promising clinical progress but also exemplified fiscal responsibility and strategic financial management.

# Strong Financial Footing

Nuvectis Pharma began the year on solid ground, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $19.5 million as of March 31, 2024, up from $19.1 million at the end of 2023. This increase is attributed to the prudent use of its at-the-market facility, which has been carefully balanced with its operational expenditures. Despite a slight increase in net loss from $4.0 million in Q1 2023 to $4.2 million in Q1 2024, the company maintains a robust financial posture. 

The company continued to invest in research and development (R&D), which is crucial for the advancement of its clinical programs, seeing a modest rise to $2.7 million from $2.4 million in the same period last year. The fact that R&D expenses represent a significant part of  the company's expenses is positive indicator for such a company. This reflects Nuvectis Pharma’s ongoing commitment to advancing its pipeline, particularly its two flagship drugs, NXP800 and NXP900.

# Pioneering Precision Medicine

At the core of Nuvectis Pharma’s mission is the development of precision medicines that target specific patient populations within the oncology sphere. This approach is not only more efficient but is increasingly seen as more effective, with therapies designed to improve outcomes for patients based on their unique genetic profiles. Precision medicine in oncology leverages detailed understanding of a patient's genetic makeup to develop treatments that are both more effective and often have fewer side effects compared to traditional therapies.

The potential of precision medicine in oncology is vividly illustrated by the recent success of Immunogen, a company that developed Elahere, a targeted therapy for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Elahere specifically targets cancer cells with minimal impact on healthy tissue, representing a significant advancement in treatment options for patients who have limited alternatives. The FDA's approval of Elahere underscores its efficacy and safety, culminating in its acquisition by Abbvie for approximately $10.1 billion. This acquisition highlights the substantial value that can be created through the development of effective treatments for cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat.

# Clinical Milestones and Management Expertise

Nuvectis Pharma is making significant advances in developing treatments for some of the hardest-to-treat cancers. Among their promising drugs, NXP800 has shown encouraging preliminary results in a study targeting a type of ovarian cancer resistant to conventional therapies. Recognizing the potential of this innovative treatment, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted it Fast Track Designation to expedite its development and review process. Moreover, NXP800 has also received Orphan Drug Designation for its use in cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and difficult-to-treat cancer. This designation is particularly important as it not only facilitates tax benefits and provides marketing exclusivity for seven years post-approval, but also may allow the drug to be given to patients under conditional marketing authorization or even compassionate use programs. These programs are crucial as they can enable patients to access new therapies prior to full approval in situations where no satisfactory alternatives exist.

NXP900, another key drug candidate from Nuvectis, targets the SRC/YES1 kinase pathway, which is integral in driving growth in several types of cancers, including lung cancer. Recent presentations at the 2024 AACR conference showcased NXP900’s potential to re-sensitize resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells to existing treatments, offering a new hope in combating this challenging disease.

The experienced leadership team at Nuvectis, led by Chairman and CEO Ron Bentsur, brings a wealth of knowledge in navigating the complex regulatory and development landscape. Their proven track record in drug development and commercialization enhances Nuvectis’ ability to successfully bring these vital new treatments to market.

# Looking Ahead

2024 is could to be a transformational year for Nuvectis Pharma. The company is likely several clinical data updates ein the second half of the year. Moreover, given its strong financial position and experienced management, the company seems well-positioned to advance its pipeline toward commercialization. Its careful financial management ensures that it has the necessary runway to reach these milestones without the immediate need for additional capital. 

As Nuvectis Pharma continues to advance its targeted therapies through clinical trials, its approach not only underscores the power of precision medicine in oncology but also exemplifies fiscal prudence and strategic agility in the biotech industry. For patients with limited treatment options and investors looking for thoughtful growth, Nuvectis stands out as a beacon of hope and a compelling investment opportunity. With a management team that blends extensive experience with a clear strategic vision, Nuvectis is adeptly navigating the complex landscape of drug development. This positions the company not only to meet current challenges but also to create substantial impact in the lives of patients worldwide, setting the stage for future successes and sustainable growth.

"Many investors hoping for a resurgence by biotech stocks have hitched their wagons to the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates. That’s a practical bet because biotech is a rate-sensitive industry. But amid concern the central bank won’t be able to cut rates over soon, that bet could be a loser.

However, there signs of life for biotech stocks. Consider the case of the ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (SBIO B-). That fund surged 7.11% last week. That move erased its YTD loss while turning SBIO solidly positive since the start of the year.

One reason for emerging optimism in the biotech space, including toward the mid- and small-cap names residing in SBIO, is that even though rate cuts might be delayed for a while, some biotech companies are renewing their commitment to R&D. R&D is the lifeblood of the biopharma industry. That sentiment is amplified for smaller companies, including SBIO holdings.

# AI Could Be Driver of Biotech R&D Efforts

What’s notable about the current renewal of biotech R&D expenditures is that AI — another innovative technology — is playing a vital role in those efforts. A [recent report by Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/life-sciences-and-health-care/articles/measuring-return-from-pharmaceutical-innovation.html) explores the role AI will play in biotech R&D. That includes bringing new efficiencies and productivity to a process that often lacks those important traits.

“Improving productivity in biopharma R&D will never be easy given the need to balance efficiency (cost) and value creation (sales), each of which depends on multiple factors that can influence the drivers of change,” noted Deloitte. “This year, regulatory changes, the impending and unprecedented scale of the loss of exclusivity of high value assets for many companies in our cohort, inflationary pressures, the rapid pace of scientific and technological advances and rising protocol design complexity are all placing significant pressures on the current R&D operating model but are also creating new opportunities to improve R&D productivity.”

# How Success Is Achieved by Smaller Biotech Firms

Some large-cap biopharma companies can endure less efficient R&D. That’s because they have the capital to wait out those bumps. However, the same isn’t true of many smaller counterparts whose success hinges on the development and approval of a single drug or therapy.

SBIO diminishes some of that risk. That’s because its underlying index mandates that member firms have at least one drug in Phase II or III clinical trials. It also mandates that those companies have enough capital to survive at least two years on current cash burn rates. That confirms AI could be important to those firms’ efforts to efficiently bring new treatments to market.

“It is therefore important to understand both the trends in costs to develop an asset from discovery to launch and the risk-adjusted forecast revenue of the assets in the pipeline,” concluded Deloitte.

"FSD Pharma Submits a Phase-1 Multiple Ascending Doses Clinical Trial Application for Lucid-21-302 (Lucid-MS) for Ethics Committee Review in Australia

TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / May 7, 2024 / FSD Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:HUGE)(CSE:HUGE)(FRA:0K9A) (""FSD Pharma"" or the ""Company""), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to building a portfolio of innovative assets and biotech solutions to address ailments affecting millions worldwide, today announces the submission to ethics of a trial entitled ""A Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multiple Ascending Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Lucid-21-302 in Healthy Adult Participants."" 

This clinical trial application is submitted for review by a human ethics review committee (HREC) in Australia, a step that is necessary to obtain permission to initiate the multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial. The MAD trial follows the Phase-1 single ascending dose (SAD) trial that was recently completed.

Lucid-21-302 is a first-in-class, non-immunomodulatory, neuroprotective compound with a unique mechanism of action for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is a patented New Chemical Entity that has been shown in preclinical models to prevent demyelination, a known cause of MS and other neurogenerative diseases characterized by damage to the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers in the central nervous system. In the prior Phase-1 single ascending dose (SAD) study, Lucid-21-302 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated in the dose range of 50-300 mg administered once orally to healthy adults, with no difference in pharmacokinetics between the fed and fasted states.

""We are eager to study multiple doses of Lucid-21-302 in healthy volunteers as this marks an important next step in advancing Lucid-21-302 into an optimally designed phase-2 clinical trial. We are very optimistic about the potential of Lucid-21-302 as a first-in-class, non-immunomodulatory treatment for MS as it progresses to the next phase of clinical development,"" said Dr. Andrzej Chruscinski, Vice-President, Scientific and Clinical Affairs at FSD Pharma."


"**Trial Day 6**

Katherine & Trent Jackson was in court.

**Cardiologist Dr. Daniel Wohlgelernter testimony**

**Jackson Direct**

Cardiologist Dr. Daniel Wohlgelernter testifying as an expert witness for Katherine Jackson. He is a Yale Medical School Graduate and has practiced in Southern California since 1985. Dr. Daniel Wohlgelernter, has taught at Yale and UCLA. He practices in Santa Monica, California

During the morning session, the Dr. testified about elements of the contract, including descriptions of med equipment included in the contract

Murray's agreement to close down his Las Vegas clinic to work full time for Jackson created a conflict, he said. The agreement said Murray could lose his job if the tour was delayed or canceled. 

>""It meant that Dr. Murray was entirely dependent on the continuation of the tour for his income,"" he said

Wohlgelernter also said he was troubled by a section of Murray's contract that said the doctor was to 

>""Perform the Services reasonably requested by the Producer"" (which was AEG). That meant Murray was ""responsible and accountable to a third party, namely AEG Live"", Wohlgelernter said, ""not his patient, leading to a conflict of interest""

Dr. Wohlgelernter testified that Propofol needs to be administered by an Anesthesiologist who is properly trained. Wohlgelernter testified that propofol should be given only in a hospital setting and administered by an anesthesiologist because there is a risk the patient can stop breathing

>""Cardiologists, like Murray, are not competent to administer propofol"", he said.

Wohlgelernter said Murray ""was not fit and competent in so far as he administered medications he was not trained and credentialed to administer and administered them in a whole unsatisfactory environment.""

Dr. Wohlgelernter said Murray was not the right doctor - not appropriately trained for what MJ had - substance abuse, addiction, and a sleep disorder

>""Michael Jackson had a history of substance abuse, addiction to medications and sleep disturbance,"" he said, ""not heart or cardiovascular problems""

Wohlgelernter said Murray did not have the appropriate training to serve as Jackson's physician for the This Is It tour. Instead of a cardiologist like Murray, the expert witness said that Jackson needed a doctor who was trained in addiction medicine, substance abuse and sleep disorders. Since Jackson had no evidence of heart disease, Murray was not an appropriate choice to treat him, the witness said.

Attorneys for both sides told the panel last week that Jackson suffered from longstanding prescription drug addiction issues, which Wohlgelernter said Murray had no formal training on how to treat. The former cardiologist was also unqualified to administer propofol, the powerful anesthetic that killed him

>""For Michael Jackson, given that he had no history of heart disease... a cardiologist's experience and skills and credentials would not be appropriate. It's a mismatch, it's not what he needs,"" he said, adding: ""My opinion is that Dr. Murray was not an appropriate choice to serve as Michael Jackson's physician on the This is It tour. It's not the right doctor for this patient.""

Wohlgelernter said the fact that Dr. Conrad Murray, a cardiologist, shut his practice to care only for Jackson, who had no history of heart problems:

>""that to me is a red flag"", Wohlgelernter said. 

He asked why Murray would:

> ""leave what he was doing for a patient who doesn't need his services?""

The physician said he and Murray had received much of the same types of training over the courses of their careers, but that only anesthesiologists should administer propofol and that treating addiction or insomnia requires specialized training.

>Jackson lawyer: ""Do you believe Conrad Murray was competent and fit for AEG to hire?""   
>  
>Dr. Wohlgelernter: ""No""

Doctor testified he thought Dr. Murray not up to the Standard of care because of his only admission that MJ had stopped breathing. Dr. Wohlgelernter said Dr. Murray should have opened an airway but instead chose chest compressions.

He testified that Murray gave MJ incorrect treatment when he noticed Michael had stopped breathing as a result of Propofol Murray had administered.

Wohlgelernter told the jurors that Murray improperly focused on Jackson's heart when Michael stopped breathing after receiving propofol and other drugs on the morning of 6/25/09. Dr. Wohlgelernter said that Murray used chest compressions when he saw that Jackson was in distress, rather than focusing on getting his breathing restarted.

>""My opinion is that Conrad Murray repeatedly failed (to meet) the standard of care in his treatment of Michael Jackson,"" he said.

Wohlgelernter said Murray made repeated mistakes, including using propofol outside of a hospital, leaving Jackson unattended, focusing on his heart rather than breathing when he found him apparently lifeless, and delaying calling 911.

>""My opinion is that these departures from the standard of care... were a substantial factor in the death of Michael Jackson,"" said the senior cardiologist

**AEG Cross**

AEG attorney Cahan tried to get the Dr. to change his opinion that Murray was unqualified to treat addiction, sleep issues. The Dr stuck to his opinion that Murray was unqualified to treat Jackson. He did say Murray was qualified as an internal medicine doctor

Under cross-examination by Cahan, Wohlgelernter testified that Murray's training and credentials were reputable and he appeared to be a competent internal medicine physician

The Dr. was also asked about Dr. Murray's training and education. He said Murray studied, trained at respectable institutions.

Wohlgelernter, however, said Jackson's request for Murray to be his doctor and Murray's desire to leave other patients behind to work with the singer should have caused AEG some concern. Wohlgelernter said the company should have asked why the two men wanted to work with each other

The witness also said that Murray's request for a CPR machine, written into his contract, a device used when patients undergo heart surgery, should have raised questions:

>""What is this doctor planning to do?"", Wohlgelernter asked, ""What are his treatment plans in taking care of Michael Jackson?""

Another warning, he said, was Jackson's request for Murray, considering the singer's background with drug use.

> ""It's a red flag to the extent that Michael Jackson has a history of substance abuse and addiction that he specifically is requesting a given doctor who has no training in any of those areas. What is the nature of this relationship? Why do these two want each other?""

Cahan asked the Dr to testify about Murray's proposed contract w/ AEG. Doctor said he wasn't qualified to testify about its elements

Contract shows that Dr. Murray was hired to be MJ's General Practitioner

The contract shown was only signed by Dr. Murray not by AEG or MJ. Dr. Wohlgelernter did no know if Dr. Murray was ever paid.

Dr. said he has never administered propofol and he's never written a patient a prescription for propofol.

Cahan asked about whether he'd heard of different classes of doctors and internists administering propofol. The Dr said no each time. He also said he'd never heard of an anesthesiologist administering propofol in a residence.

Cahan asked similar questions about CPR. He said it was reasonable to expect a cardiologist, internist, etc. to give proper CPR.

Cahan did ask the doctor if the company could have asked Murray about Jackson's medical conditions. Dr. Wohlgelernter said they couldn't have because of HIPPA (the medical privacy law). Jackson's medical info could have been disclosed with a waiver, he said

The doctor concluded his testimony by saying he wasn't aware of any investigation AEG did into Murray's background

"The University of Missouri and Columbia University in New York have partnered up for a “moonshot” project called NOVA Joint: the development of a fully biological knee replacement grown in a lab, which might be ready for patients in the next five years.

The partnership is one of five teams working on projects from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. The team will receive $39 million in funding if it continues to meet the project’s milestones.

The science and engineering behind the NOVA Joint will come primarily out of Columbia University, with MU advising. MU will then be responsible for animal trials in Year Two and clinical trials in subsequent years.

The knee replacement would involve growing cartilage and bone from a patient’s own cells or donor cells, said James Cook, MU’s principal investigator on the project. Cook is a veterinarian, Ph.D. and vice chair of orthopedic research at MU.

“When you put (the knee replacement) in, it can stand up to the rigors of not only daily life, but recreation and sport and all those things,” Cook said. “It is like growing a brand new joint.”

Three of the project’s developers called it a “moonshot.”

“The impact here is not just if this can be done, the impact and the ‘moonshot’ is can this be done under these constraints and requirements that are mandated by the program,” said Nadeen Chahine, an associate professor of biomedical engineering in orthopedic surgery at Columbia University.

Two versions of the replacement will be created with the hopes they will be more reliable than the traditional knee replacement. One version of the joint will be grown with donated cells and is expected to be created within 24 hours of knowing who the patient is. This is considered the more “off the shelf” concept, but still poses a large challenge for researchers.

The other option involves growing replacement tissue within 30 days using the patient’s own cells. These processes do not grow brand new knees, but rather stem cells and tissues that are then delivered into the joint along with biodegradable material that will support the joint until it is reabsorbed by the body. This material will degrade as the new cells begin to grow and eventually fully support the joint.

“We would love to try and do something perfectly, and I think the only way really is to try and restore your joint to the way God made it,” Cook said. “You know: beautiful, white, glistening, smooth cartilage that resurfaces your whole joint and allows you to do all the things a normal knee can do.”

The project aims to combat osteoarthritis, which affects 15% of people 30 years and older, according to a Lancet study. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is mostly found in the hands, hips and knees, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the disease, the cartilage in a joint breaks down, leading to pain, stiffness and swelling. Treatment typically involves physical therapy, medications and, in cases where all else fails, joint replacement.

“It is a tremendous quality of life disease, and the huge burden is not just in the disability that the patients exhibit and experience, but also in the impact on their ability to sustain their lives,” Chahine said.

The current treatment for the worst cases of the disease is total knee replacement. These replacements are made out of metal or plastic and often have to be redone a few years after they are placed. Additionally, these replacements often limit patient movement while still improving their condition from before the replacement. Cook’s motivation in the project is driven by personal experience. His grandfather needed eight revision surgeries on his knee replacement and he ended up in a wheelchair at the end of his life as a result.

“When you get artificial joint replacement, you’ve gotta change your lifestyle, and if you live more than 15 years, you gotta expect to have it done again,” Cook said.

The project is made more challenging by a commercialization aspect. The project will not be considered complete until researchers can bring the treatment to the marketplace in an affordable way, if the team makes it that far. Several milestones are related to the scaling and affordability of the treatment.

The program kicked off in the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma due to the prevalence of osteoarthritis in Native Americans, with the goal of addressing barriers in getting this new technology to all patients in an affordable way. To do this, communication between researchers and organizations, like Medicare, Medicaid and insurers, is needed.

“The goal here is to not only create an implant that’s going to be one-and-done and live with the patient for the rest of their lives, but to also bring down the cost of medical care,” Chahine said.

The loftiness of this goal highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach. The two universities hold biweekly Zoom meetings with people from a wide variety of departments, ranging from engineers to regulatory and ethics personnel. This need for cooperation and playing to individual strengths is the reason for MU and Columbia University’s partnership.

Hung and Cook have known each other for around 20 years and have collaborated on multiple research studies and grants. Hung turned to Cook and MU for this project because of their experience and knowledge with research leading to clinical trials.

Cook’s research has led to several innovations, such as a test to detect arthritis before symptoms develop and pioneering a way to double the shelf life of donor cartilage tissue. That discovery has played an important role in the Missouri Joint Preservation Project. Prior to the current project, Cook’s research helped create the Missouri BioJoint Center, which developed procedures using tissue from deceased donors in knee replacements. In 2021, the university settled a number of personal injury and false advertisement lawsuits related to the BioJoint Center for $16 million.

Despite the lawsuits, the center laid the groundwork to help make this program possible through the research and experience it provided, Cook said. Additionally, the program helped show that MU was capable of running a large and complex program backed by government funding."
"The University of Missouri and Columbia University in New York have partnered up for a “moonshot” project called NOVA Joint: the development of a fully biological knee replacement grown in a lab, which might be ready for patients in the next five years.

The partnership is one of five teams working on projects from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. The team will receive $39 million in funding if it continues to meet the project’s milestones.

The science and engineering behind the NOVA Joint will come primarily out of Columbia University, with MU advising. MU will then be responsible for animal trials in Year Two and clinical trials in subsequent years.

The knee replacement would involve growing cartilage and bone from a patient’s own cells or donor cells, said James Cook, MU’s principal investigator on the project. Cook is a veterinarian, Ph.D. and vice chair of orthopedic research at MU.

“When you put (the knee replacement) in, it can stand up to the rigors of not only daily life, but recreation and sport and all those things,” Cook said. “It is like growing a brand new joint.”

Three of the project’s developers called it a “moonshot.”

“The impact here is not just if this can be done, the impact and the ‘moonshot’ is can this be done under these constraints and requirements that are mandated by the program,” said Nadeen Chahine, an associate professor of biomedical engineering in orthopedic surgery at Columbia University.

Two versions of the replacement will be created with the hopes they will be more reliable than the traditional knee replacement. One version of the joint will be grown with donated cells and is expected to be created within 24 hours of knowing who the patient is. This is considered the more “off the shelf” concept, but still poses a large challenge for researchers.

The other option involves growing replacement tissue within 30 days using the patient’s own cells. These processes do not grow brand new knees, but rather stem cells and tissues that are then delivered into the joint along with biodegradable material that will support the joint until it is reabsorbed by the body. This material will degrade as the new cells begin to grow and eventually fully support the joint.

“We would love to try and do something perfectly, and I think the only way really is to try and restore your joint to the way God made it,” Cook said. “You know: beautiful, white, glistening, smooth cartilage that resurfaces your whole joint and allows you to do all the things a normal knee can do.”

The project aims to combat osteoarthritis, which affects 15% of people 30 years and older, according to a Lancet study. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is mostly found in the hands, hips and knees, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the disease, the cartilage in a joint breaks down, leading to pain, stiffness and swelling. Treatment typically involves physical therapy, medications and, in cases where all else fails, joint replacement.

“It is a tremendous quality of life disease, and the huge burden is not just in the disability that the patients exhibit and experience, but also in the impact on their ability to sustain their lives,” Chahine said.

The current treatment for the worst cases of the disease is total knee replacement. These replacements are made out of metal or plastic and often have to be redone a few years after they are placed. Additionally, these replacements often limit patient movement while still improving their condition from before the replacement. Cook’s motivation in the project is driven by personal experience. His grandfather needed eight revision surgeries on his knee replacement and he ended up in a wheelchair at the end of his life as a result.

“When you get artificial joint replacement, you’ve gotta change your lifestyle, and if you live more than 15 years, you gotta expect to have it done again,” Cook said.

The project is made more challenging by a commercialization aspect. The project will not be considered complete until researchers can bring the treatment to the marketplace in an affordable way, if the team makes it that far. Several milestones are related to the scaling and affordability of the treatment.

The program kicked off in the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma due to the prevalence of osteoarthritis in Native Americans, with the goal of addressing barriers in getting this new technology to all patients in an affordable way. To do this, communication between researchers and organizations, like Medicare, Medicaid and insurers, is needed.

“The goal here is to not only create an implant that’s going to be one-and-done and live with the patient for the rest of their lives, but to also bring down the cost of medical care,” Chahine said.

The loftiness of this goal highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach. The two universities hold biweekly Zoom meetings with people from a wide variety of departments, ranging from engineers to regulatory and ethics personnel. This need for cooperation and playing to individual strengths is the reason for MU and Columbia University’s partnership.

Hung and Cook have known each other for around 20 years and have collaborated on multiple research studies and grants. Hung turned to Cook and MU for this project because of their experience and knowledge with research leading to clinical trials.

Cook’s research has led to several innovations, such as a test to detect arthritis before symptoms develop and pioneering a way to double the shelf life of donor cartilage tissue. That discovery has played an important role in the Missouri Joint Preservation Project. Prior to the current project, Cook’s research helped create the Missouri BioJoint Center, which developed procedures using tissue from deceased donors in knee replacements. In 2021, the university settled a number of personal injury and false advertisement lawsuits related to the BioJoint Center for $16 million.

Despite the lawsuits, the center laid the groundwork to help make this program possible through the research and experience it provided, Cook said. Additionally, the program helped show that MU was capable of running a large and complex program backed by government funding."

"REGAL is for AML CR2 maintenance therapy- as you know, no possibility for such patients to go ahead with a stem cell transplant (HSCT)

In the Uproleselan Phase 3 Trial the treatment is for r/r AML in induction and consolidation trherapy, potentially bridging to HSCT (big difference with REGAL). Its primary endpoint **is overall survival without censoring for transplant**, while secondary endpoints included the incidence of various oral mucositis, complete remission rate and remission rate. Despite not meeting the primary endpoint, subjects treated with uproleselan experienced a median overall survival of 13 months, as opposed to 12.3 months in the control arm. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/glycomimetics-reports-data-phase-iii-092158206.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/glycomimetics-reports-data-phase-iii-092158206.html)

The main question here, for setting benchmarks and comparisons, is  to understand **‘how many patients in both arms underwent a stem cell transplantation’?** This can affect the overall survival, as we know transplant is the best treatment for AML patients.

[https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03616470](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03616470)

For example -- In the Uproleselan phase 1/2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11017789/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11017789/) 47 r/r AML patients were treated at the recommended dose (10 mg/kg twice daily), and **the median overall survival (OS) was 8.8 months.**

Out of these 47 patients, 31% (17 patients) proceeded to HSCT (see Table 3). Among patients who underwent transplantation after uproleselan at 10 mg/kg plus MEC, the median OS was not reached, and **for those who did not undergo transplantation after uproleselan at 10 mg/kg plus MEC, the median survival was 5.8 months (fig 3B)**

https://preview.redd.it/2bug12yjrzyc1.jpg?width=1073&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b00d83b7518c5535cebf6bd6be998c699e73053f

Therefore, for Phase 3 GLYC study, **it would be good to know the overall survival of**  **AML patients after censoring for transplant**.

In the 2021 paper ‘Clinical and molecular predictors of response and survival following venetoclax therapy in relapsed/refractory AML’‘https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/5/5/1552/475453/Clinical-and-molecular-predictors-of-response-and Stahl et al. studied 86 patients with  AML who were treated with venetoclax combinations. The Median overall survival (OS) was 25 months for patients treated with azacitidine + venetoclax, but it then decreased to 8.1 months  when patients were censored for subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation.  "

"A new review of the science around the components of marijuana says the “complex interaction between phytocannabinoids and biological systems offers hope for novel treatment approaches,” laying the groundwork for a new era of innovation in cannabis-based medicines.

Among other takeaways, the report, published earlier this month in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, underscores the potential of whole-plant cannabis medicine—incorporating the variety of cannabinoids, terpenes and other compounds produced by the cannabis plant—rather than simply THC or CBD on their own.

“The plant *Cannabis* exhibits an effect called the ‘entourage effect’, in which the combined actions of terpenes and phytocannabinoids results in effects that exceed the sum of their separate contributions,” the study says. “This synergy emphasizes how important it is to consider the entire plant when utilizing cannabinoids medicinally as opposed to just concentrating on individual cannabinoids.”

A new review of the science around the components of marijuana says the “complex interaction between phytocannabinoids and biological systems offers hope for novel treatment approaches,” laying the groundwork for a new era of innovation in cannabis-based medicines.

Among other takeaways, the report, published earlier this month in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, underscores the potential of whole-plant cannabis medicine—incorporating the variety of cannabinoids, terpenes and other compounds produced by the cannabis plant—rather than simply THC or CBD on their own.

“The plant *Cannabis* exhibits an effect called the ‘entourage effect’, in which the combined actions of terpenes and phytocannabinoids results in effects that exceed the sum of their separate contributions,” the study says. “This synergy emphasizes how important it is to consider the entire plant when utilizing cannabinoids medicinally as opposed to just concentrating on individual cannabinoids.”

Much of the 23-page report—from pharmacy researchers at Ovidus University of Constanta and the University of Medicine, Pharmacy Science and Technology of Târgu Mures, both of which are in Romania—comprises an overview of cannabinoids, including THC and CBD as well as cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THC-V)—as well as how those compounds appear to interact with the human body.

While the vast majority of research has studied THC and CBD, the new review notes that the “exploration of novel phytocannabinoids is rapidly evolving, offering exciting prospects for future therapeutic applications.”

“Beyond well-established compounds like THC and CBD, the quest for novel cannabinoids widens the scope of potential treatments,” it says. “Each cannabinoid, with its unique chemical structure, interacts differently with the \[endocannabinoid system\], suggesting tailored therapeutic effects for specific conditions. This exploration seeks to harness similar benefits while circumventing associated drawbacks.”

Each of the chemical components has specific effects, which the study briefly describes. The broad review, which cites nearly 100 other sources, acknowledges that some effects are bolstered by robust scientific evidence, while others are still being explored.

THC, for example, has demonstrated analgesic effects, authors wrote. “It also possesses antiemetic effects, which make it useful for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”

CBD, meanwhile, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties and “is said to have analgesic properties and may be effective in pain management.” Some research also shows the cannabinoid may have neuroprotective qualities.

While CBD formulations like the prescription drug Epidiolex can treat rare forms of epilepsy, mixes of CBD and THC may help address spasticity related to multiple sclerosis, the paper says.

Both THC and CBD also have antioxidant effects, it adds, and both appear to be promising tools for a variety of ailments, from pain to neurological disorders and psychiatric conditions.

Further, CBD may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and PTSD, while both THC and CBD may exhibit antidepressant effects. “While some findings suggest that cannabinoids may have mood-stabilizing effects and enhance serotonin signaling, the evidence is inconclusive, and further research is needed,” the study says.

CBD may also help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms of alcohol and opioid use disorders, although authors said “the evidence is preliminary, and more research is needed to establish its efficacy and safety.”

Both THC and CBD have also been investigated as possible sleep aids, though results are still preliminary and so far are mixed, with some patients experiencing improved sleep quality while others experience sleep disruptions.

As for treating cancer, the report says that studies have indicated that “cannabinoids can exert antitumor effects directly by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, or indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.”

“In vivo and in vitro research has demonstrated the efficacy of cannabinoids in modulating tumor growth, although the antitumor effects can vary depending on the type of cancer and the concentration of the drug,” it continues. “For cancer patients, it is crucial to comprehend how cannabinoids control immune system interactions and other biological processes related to carcinogenesis, such as cell cycle progression, proliferation, and cell death. Additional research is necessary for this area.”

As for minor cannabinoids, compounds such as CBG and CBN appear to have antibacterial effects, researchers found. CBN itself also appears to be a mild sedative, which could be relevant for treating sleep disorders.

THC-V, meanwhile, may act as an appetite suppressant and a “potential treatment for diabetes.”

Cannabinoids may also be helpful in treating trauma wounds, authors noted, potentially reducing perceived pain, inflammation and secondary tissue damage.

“At the site of injury, cannabinoids may decrease the release of tissue activators and sensitizers, modulating nerve cells to control tissue destruction and immune cells to prevent the release of proinflammatory substances,” they wrote. “This modulation helps minimize pain and temper post-injury responses associated with inflammatory injury.”

The review also assesses the “challenges and controversies” surrounding research and use of therapeutic cannabinoids, including legal and regulatory obstacles that still vary widely across the globe, a lack of robust standardization of cannabinoid products and the potential for abuse and dependence.

THC, researchers acknowledge, is not only the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis but also the most common cannabinoid associated with problem use. “While the overall risk of addiction to THC is lower compared to substances like opioids, amphetamines, or alcohol,” authors wrote, “it is still a concern, particularly for individuals who use cannabis frequently or in high doses.”

On the other hand, CBD “is not associated with the same potential for abuse or dependence” and “may even have potential therapeutic effects in reducing addiction to other substances, such as opioids, alcohol, or nicotine.”

Social and legal obstacles, the study noted, still make research onerous.

“Despite its potential, legal restrictions and societal stigma surrounding cannabis hinder investment in research and development,” authors of the study wrote. “Complex regulatory frameworks further complicate exploration efforts. Rigorous preclinical and clinical trials are imperative to establish safety and efficacy before therapeutic implementation.”

As cannabinoids and the body’s own endocannabinoid system continue to be better understood, the researchers expect even more “potential in managing various pathological diseases.”

“Phytocannabinoids offer diverse therapeutic applications, ranging from pain management to neurological disorders and inflammatory diseases. Their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties make them valuable candidates for combating antibiotic resistance and modulating inflammatory pathways,” the [study](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/8/4204) concludes. “By leveraging the synergistic effects of combination therapies and targeting multiple disease pathways, phytocannabinoids hold immense potential to revolutionize the future of pharmacotherapy and improve human health outcomes.”

The new research is part of a growing field of investigation into the entourage effect in cannabis as well as in entheogenic plants and fungi. While Western medicine typically seeks to identify and isolate a single active ingredient, the findings underscore the potentially powerful interactions of various chemical components produced by the plant.

Earlier this year, for example, a study looked at the [“collaborative interactions” between cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and other molecules in the plant](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/new-study-shows-how-marijuana-compounds-like-cannabinoids-terpenes-and-flavonoids-interact-for-medical-benefits/), concluding that a better understanding of the relationships of various chemical components “is crucial for unraveling cannabis’s complete therapeutic potential.”

Other recent research funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found that a citrusy-smelling terpene in marijuana, D-limonene, [could help ease anxiety and paranoia associated with THC](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/a-citrusy-smelling-terpene-in-marijuana-can-reduce-anxiety-and-paranoia-caused-by-thc-federally-funded-study-finds/). Researchers similarly said the finding could help unlock the maximum therapeutic benefit of THC.

A separate study last year found that cannabis products [with a more diverse array of natural cannabinoids produced stronger psychoactive experiences](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-entourage-effect-with-multiple-cannabinoids-produces-a-stronger-and-longer-lasting-high-than-pure-thc-study-finds/) in adults, which also lasted longer than the high generated by pure THC.

And a 2018 study found that patients suffering from epilepsy experience better health outcomes—with fewer adverse side effects—[when they use plant-based CBD extracts compared to “purified” CBD products](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/whole-plant-marijuana-entourage-effect-helps-patients-more-than-purified-cbd-study-finds/).

Scientist last year also discovered [“previously unidentified cannabis compounds” called flavorants](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/researchers-identify-previously-undiscovered-cannabis-compounds-that-give-marijuana-strains-their-unique-aromas/) that they believe are responsible for the unique aromas of different varieties of marijuana. Previously, many had thought terpenes alone were responsible for various smells produced by the plant.

Similar phenomena are also beginning to be recorded around psychedelic plants and fungi. In March, for example, researchers published findings showing that [use of full-spectrum psychedelic mushroom extract had a more powerful effect than chemically synthesized psilocybin alone](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/study-finds-natural-psychedelic-mushrooms-produce-enhanced-effects-compared-to-synthesized-psilocybin-suggesting-entourage-effect/). They said the findings imply that mushrooms, like cannabis, demonstrate an entourage effect.

"## Abstract

>**Objectives:** Common age-related health conditions can lead to poor mental health outcomes and deteriorate cognition. Additionally, commonly prescribed medications for various mental/physical health conditions may cause adverse reactions, especially among older adults. Psychedelic therapy has shown positive impacts on cognition and has been successful in treating various mental health problems without long-lasting adversities. The current study examines the association between psychedelic drug usage and cognitive functions in middle-aged and older adults.  
>  
>**Methods:** Data were from wave 3 (2013–2014) of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. We used multiple linear regression models examining associations between psychedelic usage and cognitive functions, controlling for covariates of sociodemographic and health factors.  
>  
>**Results:** We included 2,503 individuals (*M*age = 64 ± 11). After controlling for covariates, the finding revealed that psychedelic usage was independently associated with more favorable changes in executive function (β = .102, *SE* = 0.047, *p* = .031) and less depressive symptoms (β = −.090, *SE* = 0.021, *p* < .001). The same effect was not found for episodic memory (β = .039, *SE* = 0.066, *p* = .553).  
>  
>**Discussion:** Addressing the mental health implications of physical health conditions in older adults are vital for preventing neurocognitive deterioration, prolonging independence, and improving the quality of life. More longitudinal research is essential utilizing psychedelics as an alternative therapy examining late-life cognitive benefits.

## Limitations

>Multiple limitations should be considered in interpreting the current result. First, psychedelic therapy requires longer time than other therapies (up to 12 hr per session), a properly prepared environment for the therapy session, and monitoring throughout the session ([Psiuk et al., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr38-23337214241250108)). Because of its cross-sectional nature, our study did not consider longer follow-up. ***Another issue with psychedelic therapy is that the hallucinations caused by psychedelic compounds may be too overwhelming for some patients*** ([Psiuk et al., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr38-23337214241250108)). Although from the nature of the MIDUS questionnaire it seems that ***much of the use was as off-label recreational purposes, with little understanding of dosage or safety, side effects and high dosages of certain psychedelics may outweigh the benefits***. The most common side effects of psychedelic therapy are short-term anxiety, psychological discomfort, headache, nausea, and vomiting ([Psiuk et al., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr38-23337214241250108)). ***Micro-dosing (small, reoccurring doses that do not alter perception) psilocybin or LSD may be a useful option for those who want to prevent the hallucinogenic effects.*** However, from the existing MIDUS data, it is impossible to find out the exact form, frequency, and dosing of psychedelics used by the participants, inducing generalizability concerns. Additionally, given the broad age range of participants, from middle-aged to older adults, a potential generalizability bias in the results may arise from variations in baseline cognitive functions. Finally, even after growing scientific interest in psychedelic medicines in recent years, their usage is limited even by physicians, probably due to hesitancy from its scientific evidence of risks and limited latest knowledge about psychedelics. For example, only a little over 8% of participants used psychedelics (including both classical and atypical psychedelics), as a key limitation of our analysis, posing some concern about our result; however, many participants were hesitant (around 1.5% refused to answer the question) to respond about psychedelic usage, reducing the chance of achieving stronger findings.

# Conclusion

>In conclusion, population aging is causing a significant increase in mental and physical health problems that negatively impact the quality of life of older adults. Many current treatment options have proved to be ineffective and lead to even worse health outcomes. Alternative therapies for age-related diseases are necessary because there are ramifications of consuming various prescription medications. Polypharmacy is common in older adults, and many current drug treatments for age-related illnesses cause adverse side effects and interact poorly with each other. Adverse drug reactions contribute to disability and the increasing need for care in older adults. For example, long-term use of immunosuppressants can lead to health ramifications like diabetes, infections, hypertension, and osteoporosis ([Lallana & Fadul, 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr28-23337214241250108); [Ruiz & Kirk, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr43-23337214241250108)); this is concerning because various age-related illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and lupus are treated with immunosuppressants ([Lallana & Fadul, 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr28-23337214241250108)). Furthermore, many of these age-related illnesses are an emotional burden to live with, which leads to hopelessness, isolation, and depression.  
>  
>Depression can lead to cognitive impairment and, ultimately, dementia. Although research on long-term psychedelic usage is limited, recent evidences suggest benefits of serotonergic psychedelics in depression ([Husain et al., 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr23-23337214241250108); [Nutt et al., 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr35-23337214241250108)), particularly among middle-aged and older adults ([Carhart-Harris et al., 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr10-23337214241250108)). Utilizing alternative therapies like psilocybin therapy, due to its potential antidepressant but minimal adverse effects, may increase healthy life expectancy by treating mental health disorders and improving cognition ([Husain et al., 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23337214241250108#bibr23-23337214241250108)). The federal and state governments should de-criminalize psychedelics so that research can be conducted in a manner that ensures reliability and validity. More longitudinal research, including clinical and community samples, is essential utilizing psychedelics as an alternative therapy examining benefits in late-life cognitive functions. The increasing public support for pharmaceutical companies conducting psychedelic therapy clinical trials is also necessary to improve mental health management in later life. Mental and physical health are interrelated; therefore, good mental health is essential for maintaining good physical health. Overall, improving the neurocognitive and mental health of older adults using psychedelic therapy is beneficial for improving quality of life, healthcare systems, and the economy.

"Hello, I (30F) just got prescribed Azathioprine for Lupus and I was wondering if anyone else is on it / was on it and has any experiences with it good/bad.

I am not 100% sure I have Lupus. I took the Ana test and the DsDNA test which shows positive, but I don’t have any of the outwards signs or symptoms. No butterfly rash or skin rash. However, I have been having a lot of different symptoms with no answers so I was sent to rheumatology and they are trialing me on this med. Originally, they wanted to put me on Hydroxychloroquine(??) but I have a pericardial cyst and go into SVT so they were worried about that having adverse effects on the med. 

I am a bit worried and would like advice. I googled the side effects from the Mayo Clinic and it said it can cause lymphoma!? I want to stick through the trial period to see if it helps, so any advice or experience anyone has on it would be nice."

> The immunologist says the Griffith scientists were the first to identify a common trigger or cell mechanism behind both long COVID and ME/CFS.

> Her PhD student Etianne Martini Sasso describes the patients as having faulty ion channels — or doors on their natural killer cell membranes — which prevent calcium from getting in and out of the cells.

>It's the cellular equivalent of a door having a broken lock and key mechanism.

> As part of her doctoral research, Ms Martini Sasso found she could restore the function of cells taken from long COVID and ME/CFS patients by treating them in a test tube with naltrexone.

> The team's next step is to trial low-dose naltrexone in 100 long COVID patients — half will receive the drug and the remainder will be given a placebo. Researchers will be blinded to which patients receive the active medication.

> Results will be compared with 50 healthy participants.

> Blood samples will then be taken from all the volunteers and their natural killer cells will be tested before the trial, during the study and after its completion at three months.

> The trial is expected to begin later this month with patients to be recruited across Australia, predominantly in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia.

> A clinical trial of low-dose naltrexone is also planned for patients with ME/CFS."
"Introduction:

Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing various industries and reshaping traditional business models. While often associated with crypto currencies like Bit coin, block chain has far-reaching applications beyond digital currencies. In this blog, we'll delve into the fundamentals of block chain technology, explore its diverse applications, and discuss its implications for the future of business and technology.

 

1. Understanding Blockchain Technology:

At its core, block chain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that enables secure and transparent recording of transactions across a network of computers. Each transaction is stored in a ""block,"" which is linked to previous blocks, forming a continuous chain of data. Block chain operates on principles of cryptographic security, consensus mechanisms, and decentralization, eliminating the need for intermediaries and fostering trust among participants.

 

2. Applications of Block-chain Technology:

Block-chain technology has a wide range of applications across various industries, including:

 

   - Financial Services: In the financial sector, blockchain facilitates secure and efficient transactions, streamlines processes such as cross-border payments and trade finance, and enables the issuance and management of digital assets, including crypto currencies, tokens, and smart contracts.

  

   - Supply Chain Management: Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains by recording the movement of goods and verifying the authenticity and provenance of products. It enables stakeholders to track products from raw materials to final delivery, reducing fraud, counterfeiting, and supply chain inefficiencies.

  

   - Healthcare: In healthcare, blockchain technology improves data integrity, patient privacy, and interoperability of electronic health records (EHRs). It enables secure sharing of medical records among healthcare providers, facilitates drug traceability and clinical trials management, and enhances patient consent management and identity verification.

  

   - Voting and Governance: Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize voting systems and governance processes by providing tamper-proof, transparent, and auditable voting mechanisms. It enables secure and verifiable digital voting, eliminates voter fraud and manipulation, and promotes democratic participation and transparency in decision-making.

 

3. Implications of Blockchain Technology:

Block-chain technology carries significant implications for businesses, governments, and society as a whole:

 

   - Disintermediation: By eliminating intermediaries and central authorities, block chain disrupts traditional business models and enables peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized networks. This disintermediation fosters trust, reduces costs, and enhances efficiency across various industries.

  

   - Data Security and Privacy: Blockchain's cryptographic security features protect data integrity and privacy, mitigating the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. This heightened security enables secure digital transactions and ensures the confidentiality of sensitive information, enhancing consumer trust and compliance with data protection regulations.

  

   - Economic Inclusion: Blockchain technology has the potential to promote financial inclusion and empower underserved populations by providing access to banking services, digital assets, and decentralized financial products. It enables cross-border remittances, micro transactions, and access to credit and investment opportunities, bridging the gap between the banked and unbanked populations.

  

   - Regulatory Challenges: Despite its potential benefits, block-chain technology presents regulatory challenges related to legal frameworks, data protection, taxation, and compliance. Governments and regulatory bodies are grappling with the complexities of block-chain governance, seeking to balance innovation with consumer protection, financial stability, and regulatory oversight.

 

Conclusion:

As blockchain technology continues to evolve and mature, its applications and implications will shape the future of business, technology, and society. By understanding the fundamentals of blockchain, exploring its diverse applications, and addressing the regulatory challenges and opportunities it presents, organizations can harness the transformative power of block chain to drive innovation, foster trust, and unlock new possibilities in the digital economy. As we demystify block chain technology and embrace its potential, we pave the way for a more transparent, secure, and inclusive future.

I am a medical school graduate who worked several years in clinical trial research. I recently made switch in careers and am going to be teaching in a physician assistant program at a small college as a lecturer. Pursuing an MBA is something I have pushed aside for too long. I envision myself working in some sort of leadership role within a healthcare organization eventually. I got into University of South Dakota and University of Nebraska so far and wanted to see if one weighed more than the other. The appeal with USD is that it has a healthcare admin focus whereas the Neb is just a general MBA. I hope to start either one this Summer and as soon as next week. Any advice would help.

"Hello all!

I've had lymphedema for about 15 years now, starting off very mild only in my left foot, but as of 2022, its progressed into my left ankle/calf (everything under the knee). I manage at this point with compression socks, elevation and massage. My leg goes down a bit over night (and I don't wear nighttime garments but I'm looking into getting something). 

I am a part of a clinical trial run out of Stanford using Acebillustat to treat the inflammation underlaying the condition and its going well, but I've begun looking into surgical options to stabilize myself further. According to my Stanford team I'm in stage 2, so I'm expecting I'd need some type of lipo before an LVA or lymph node transfer to get the best results. 

I've seen some great results from private clinics/hospitals in CA, Boston and FL, but I'm hoping to find one in NY where I live to cut down on travel costs (I appreciate deeply the Stanford trial but outside of the care covered by insurance, all of the travel comes out of pocket so I'd like to stay as close as possible, but also with a great physician/team). 

Does anyone know of any great surgeons with success stories of lipo/LVA in NY? Any and all responses are greatly appreciated!"

"I've been taking Pregabalin at 150 mg 3x daily for over 2 years. I recently moved to a new state and during my initial evaluation at the new pain management clinic, they did the typical urine drug screen. But, it WAS sent out to a lab for confirmatory testing. 

My new PCP here is managing my Pregabalin, but I was interested in doing a spinal cord stimulator trial. So, I had my appointment and got a feeling for the clinic and see if it was a good fit. Ultimately, I decided to go back to Mayo as I just feel more comfortable there with any further procedure. Still, I contacted the pain clinic and let them know what I decided and completed a release to get my visit note. I'm disability for almost 10 years and learned to keep literally any medical note for any reason.  

Today I got my record along with results from the urine drug screen. It was an extensive screen - I mean every substance. I noticed that the Pregabalin was negative and so was every substance that was checked. However, the list didn't include Baclofen, which I'm also on and have been taking 10mg 3x daily for 5 years. 

Obviously my sample was sent to a lab due to reporting I take Pregabalin yet my screen and my lab came back negative. I've researched as much as I can but literally find no cases with a false negative unless the person wasn't taking the drug or otherwise tampered with the sample. Even a rapid metabolizer wouldn't show up negative when sent to an actual lab for that special testing they do for confirmation. I know the drug is in the capsules as it continues to manage my pain to some degree and if I miss a dose, the nerve pain is unreal and improves after taking it. Has this happened to anyone else here?

"Everyone always wonders what’s the best option for reconstituting Botox. Overall, Botox injections are relatively painless but what if there was a simple reconstituting swap that made it even less painful. The article below suggests that bacteriostatic saline has an analgesic effect with a pain reduction in about 90% of patients.   Interesting enough, it’s not standard protocol to use BAC saline in clinics. It’s left to the providers discretion. 

Below is an excerpt from  ( https://www.aestheticnursing.co.uk/content/clinical/a-study-on-the-reconstitution-of-botulinum-toxin-type-a-normal-saline-versus-bacteriostatic-saline/#:~:text=The%20study%20found%20that%20using,made%20the%20treatment%20less%20painful. ) 

There appears to be a direct link between reconstitution with bacteriostatic saline and pain reduction when botulinum toxin type A is injected. Alam et al (2002) conducted a double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT). The study found that injection pain was reduced in 90% of patients when preserved saline was used, and it had no effect on efficacy.

Some 15 patients participated in a double-blind RCT that was conducted by Van Laborde et al (2003). Patients were treated on one side of their face with botulinum toxin that was reconstituted with bacteriostatic saline. The other side was treated with botulinum toxin reconstituted with unpreserved saline. Some 87% of patients reported less pain on the side that used bacteriostatic saline. Although the study was small, the findings support other research, which suggests bacteriostatic saline has an analgesic effect.

"Dear Longs,

I wanted to help with broadening our collective understanding of several things that may be happening behind the CYDY curtain:

1) CYDY may still be finalizing IRB approvals at the various investigational sites that are being targeted for the HIV Chronic Inflammation trial. I mentioned this before but it takes time to get things through the IRB process and if everything went perfectly the first patient could be enrolled mid-late June. We will see!

2) Costs for those trials are tethered to exactly what biomarkers are being studied. We are aware of two main inflammation markers: CRP and ENGAGE. According to a recent post by u/MGK he quoted Dr. JL as stating: ""and a HOST of other Biomarkers"". I just did a general search for the cost of ENGAGE and lots of other info came up but not a direct cost tied to ENGAGE. I spoke to my primary care physician recently and asked if he knew about Interluekins. He was aware but was not sure if they had a test that he could order. He looked at his computer and they did have a blood test he could order, but it was not covered by Insurance. He did tell me it was close to $10K to test for the Interluekins. I declined but it got me thinking about all of the unusual biomarkers that CYDY will be studying and how much it might cost per blood test. So I copied and pasted my standard blood test done recently and all of the associated costs. Take a look ....this is standard stuff!

My **Blood work:**

**Laboratory - General Classification**  
TOTAL **$3,893.60**  
HC Albumin, Urine/Other, Quant - 82042 (CPT®)  
$132.00  
HC 6956 Lactoferrin Detect,Stl - 83630 (CPT®)  
$28.60  
HC Cbc W/Auto Diff - 85025 (CPT®)  
$264.00  
HC Venipuncture - 36415 (CPT®)  
$85.00  
HC Urine Routine-Micro - 81001 (CPT®)  
$277.00  
HC Psa Total - 84153 (CPT®)  
$556.00  
HC Lipid Panel - Calculated Ld - 80061 (CPT®)  
$315.00  
HC Free T4 - 84439 (CPT®)  
$460.00  
HC Highly Sensitiv Tsh - 84443 (CPT®)  
$511.00  
HC C Reactive Protein - 86140 (CPT®)  
$375.00  
HC Metabolic Pnl Comp - 80053 (CPT®)  
$489.00  
HC Creatinine Urine - 82570 (CPT®)  
$266.00  
HC Esr Automated - 85652 (CPT®)  
$135.00

You can see that for standard testing it is $3900 and CRP was $375 by itself. The less standard a biomarker is, the more expensive it probably is; including the $10K for the Interleukins. So I would imagine theENGAGE, CD4 and CD8s and whatever other 'host"" of biomarkers will add up pretty quickly. So I am making an informed assumption that each blood test for the 90 participants in the HIV Chronic Inflammation trial is going to be close to $20K - $25K. Let us start with $20K per patient per test. That is $1.8 million. I believe that at a minimum CYDY will have to do a baseline test, an interim test at 12 weeks, and a final test at 24 weeks. That puts our test total at $5.4 million. This does not include any funding towards the institution (clinic) administering the blood tests and administering the LL doses. Plus, hiring the CRO to make sure study protocols are followed and all electronic files are updated and in compliance with FDA standards. Lastly, somebody has to pay for the DSMB, and that is always the sponsor and I have no idea what those folks get paid. Therefore, my final estimate is this trial will cost CYDY anywhere from $6.0 mil to $6.5 mil. I hope I am completely wrong, but the minimum of $5.4 million comes from just the testing which is critical to our trial. 

**WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING behind the CYDY CURTAIN:**

3) From the beginning of my time investing in CYDY; I screamed for funding from BARDA, HHS, NIH, and any foundation with money. NP responded once to all of us (not me) and said Government grants would slow us down. I truly believe the Gov't was not going to grant any funds to someone who has been convicted of a crime. Obviously, we don't have to worry about that anymore and Dr. JL has a whole presentation to NIH on his Quest website. It is not a leap to suggest that Dr. JL is trying to get some NIH grant money for PASC.  Getting grants to fund research/trials is nothing new or novel. Just look at our friends at VIR, the very basis of their key studies were all funded by a variety of grants but mostly the Gates Foundation. Therefore, it is easy to understand that a study like PASC should be funded by NIH, especially since the Biden administration publicized a very large amount of funding to NIH for PASC/Long Haulers. 

It takes a lot of groundwork to get funding from NIH and you have to make a strong detailed case to receive a grant from them. I believe this is what CYDY is working on behind the scenes and having Mitch work on the costs is paramount in requesting this amount. Otto Yang and Dr. JL are banging out a suitable protocol and Cyrus might be working with potential partners and or a suitable CRO to execute the study. All of these things have to be costed out and this would take a lot of time. What gives me pause on this study is what are we going to measure as success.  I feel like to a certain extent, I would want to understand the outcomes of the HIV Chronic Inflammation trial before proceeding with PASC; but we may have some of those answers already as u/MGK pointed out in his post the other day. Dr. JL stated that they went to the NASH study and pulled evidence from there as to LL's MOA on inflammation. So maybe there is enough evidence there to promote a successful PASC study using NIH funds. 

4) We are all curious about the Glioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  mouse study at Montefore/Einstein Hospital in NY. I believe we will not hear anything soon. Why? Several reasons:

A) This trial has three arms and two of those arms used a Merck drug. I believe the drug is: *TEMODAR;* nonetheless, we never heard the results from MDA on Keytruda and LL in mice but we are very aware a study took place.  If Merck is involved with this GBM study in any way, we may not hear because of that reason alone..until such time Merck announces a partnership of some kind (which is what I am hoping for).

B) Most Scientific journals as a general rule despise data being bantered about in public before it is published. It greatly diminishes the need to read the scientific journal if the data is out in public already. So most researchers respect the scientific journal's requirement not to let data out to the public before publication.

C) Some researchers also keep quiet about their research and don't let info out to the public because they don't want others to perform a validation study so closely on the heels of the publication of their manuscript. They want the scientific community to have time to absorb the details and the work that went into the original study before it gets reinforced or refuted.

5) Who knows what could be happening with Long Lasting LL? I am sure that Dr. Sacha and Dr. Hansen are busy trying to move that project forward.

6) Still more manuscripts need to be finalized and then submitted for publication. As a reminder, once a manuscript is accepted, reviewed, and approved it takes 6-9 months (in Cardiology) to get published. Not sure what scientific journals CYDY has submitted to, but no matter what scientific journal manuscripts are submitted to there is a line of other manuscripts waiting for approval and publication.  We will know when we see the publications and not anytime soon. 

**LASTILY**

CYDY is moving at the pace that a company with limited funding and limited resources can move at. it is a slow pace and a step-by-step pace. I know it hurts all of us Longs to see the share price as low as it is, but I and many many other longs have never associated the SP with the value of Leronlimab. I know the story up until today and when the rest of the world knows the story the SP will change accordingly. Please note: the final chapters are being written now. The trials that definitively prove the worth of LL, have not been written yet. Those chapters prior have only been a tease of sorts. Earlier chapters of the story have only proved ""provocative"". The chapters that will be written will change everything for all of us and IMO the story of LL will be BIGGER than KEYTRUDA and HUMIRA combined.  As my dear friend (who used to be a stockbroker) once said when your favorite stock went down in price: ""Don't get sore buy some more"" 

I LOVE the LONGS, I LOVE LERONLIMAB, I LOVE LONG LASTING LL and I LOVE Dr. LALEZARI.

The second link indicates that the reason for the lack of info is that the page is blocked by Robots.txt, and indeed, your robots.txt file contains:Disallow: /ct2/which matches [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04510324](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04510324), and so search engines don't index it properly because you are blocking access to it.  
Also, this poor result is an improvement over the situation a few months ago, when the result was:

It should; see [https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) , for example.

"Hey OP,

Coincidentally, I recently made a short video on YouTube about clinical trials!

Thanks. Looks like a good piece to have a discussion about. I’ll read it later tonight!
"Hey Chiraag! Greta content and power point slides to guide the discussion. I think this video has a great pacing and good simplified information. Definitely along the lines of the original post theme.  What a coincidence that your upload timing was so close? Haha

My only take on it to make it even easier to digest and easier to produce would be to break it down into even smaller digestible chunks. 15 mins as an overview can be a lot to process for a newbie. What if we could abridge it, and then have more bite sized clips with specifics on the channel if they want to dig further? 

Awesome contribution."
"Hey Chiraag, nice channel! I'm curious, how did you decide to go with Youtube? Have you tried any other channels?"

"What an excellent post. About the only thing I possibly can add is a mention of Phase 0. From what I've read from various U.S./FDA based descriptions ... ""**Phase 0**: *Exploratory study involving very limited human exposure to the drug, with no therapeutic or diagnostic goals (for example, screening studies, microdose studies)[^](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/help/glossary/phase)*"" and ""*The purpose of this phase is to help speed up and streamline the drug approval process[^](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199854)*.""

I would mention that there are detractors to this phase, whose concerns are spelled out in this article '[FDA Introduces New Phase 0 for Clinical Trials : Oncology Times](https://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2006/08100/FDA_Introduces_New_Phase_0_for_Clinical_Trials_.6.aspx?WT.mc_id=HPxADx20100319xMP).'"
How do I apply?
"A lot of times the site/doctor can get the sponsor of the trial to pay for transportation, you just need to ask or imply that participating will be difficult without help."
Thanks. Mom's willing to take me.... for 33% of the take.
"Also, it's not just paying for transportation. It's actually getting there. Do you think the NIAID would send somebody to my house to pick me up and then take me home?"
"They would pay for uber/taxi, but yes"
"Well, the trial I just tried to apply for said no, and it turns out that I don't qualify anyway because my Vyvanse would cause failed drug screens."
"Well, 'uncomfortable' probably means 'not meeting inclusion criteria'. You'll need far more detailed information to find out if someone is eligible for open clinical trials, so he can best ask his doctor. "

I am not but I ran into them a year or so ago at SXSW before I was diagnosed with melanoma in situ. It looked and sounded really promising.  I didn’t realize they were still in clinical trials.
That’s awesome that you can get in!!
i read an article about the vaccine itself when i first got diagnosed i didn’t even know they were giving it to people in trials. I’m hoping it helps it seems like it has great results so far from the information my doctor gave me. My doctor is in a bigger city but still surprised it was offered.
"I’m hoping it works, I didn’t even know they were doing trials. My doctor is in a bigger city but still wasn’t expecting it. He mainly wants me to do it because i’m only 21 and he wants to give me my best chances."
It’s amazing for sure!
"Rinvoq has been pretty amazing. Works very quickly and is also very effective. It's the first medication that raw numbers wise gets a higher response rate than Infliximab (Remicade).

The side effects sound bad, but they're applied to a class of drugs. The older generation of JAK inhibitors were pan JAK inhibitors and had more side effects. Rinvoq is selective and targets mostly JAK 1 so has a better safety profile. This matters because blocking the JAK 2 pathway is where the bleeding and clotting risks are from.

I'd really suggest talking over the safety profile with the doctor or since you're in the hospital a clinical pharmacist. They can discuss what's been seen in Rinvoq only and which ones are from the pan JAK inhibitors."
"I haven’t actually heard of Xeljanz!

I’ve just started Rinvoq myself, but from what I’ve seen it seems to work quite well for many people who have failed at least one biologic. I have high hopes for myself but I’m only 3 days in haha. From what I’ve read the biggest side effect people have with it is acne. All I know about pregnancy and this drug is not to take it if pregnant. So your girl will be 100% fine in that regard. 

I’d highly suggest searching Rinvoq/Upadacitinib on this sub and seeing other peoples experiences! It was what pushed me to choose this drug."
"Rinvoq got my symptoms in control in like 2 weeks. We've had to fart around with dosage a few times, but its been great. Had some acne as a side effect, not sure how applicable that will be with the little one though.

As far as the pregnancy stuff.... with this med, probably not. From what I understand it failed some pretty early studies as to safety of the fetus, but at the same time, by the time this is in the cards for her, there will likely be several additional options in play.

(Trust antimodez on this one, i'm operating off of VERY weak second hand knowledge here haha)"
No advices ( I'm way too new to all of this to know much . But I just wanted to say you're a good mom <3
"I’ve been on Xeljanz about 4 or so years now. It’s been a game changer, I’m technically in remission (only some microscopic inflammation on biopsy) and have pretty much no limitations. I get my bloodwork and did get some vaccines prior to starting, but it’s been great to go back to a pill after shots and infusions."
"I’m not on either of those, but I have heard good things about them working. Also, you can’t apparently develop antibodies to them; so you don’t have to necessarily worry about if she goes off of it will it give her an allergic reaction later on if she tries to use it again.

The pregnancy concern: I don’t know if I quite understand your question; she’s 6 years old…are you worried if she has to take the medication for the rest of her life that she won’t be able to have kids while she’s on it because of risk to fetus? That might be valid but more studies are needed I think.

If you’re worried that somehow taking those meds will make her infertile later on, I would be very very very shocked if that was a risk. It actually seems pretty unlikely for that to be the case at all.

I had a massive flare when I was pregnant…had to do a colonoscopy and everything..took prednisone. Was not fun but my daughter is totally fine!"

"I'm glad that she went through the scope well and was happy doing it. I've had crohns for 10 years. I've enever heard of either of the meds that you mentioned the doctor starting on. I would definitely ask the doctor how this could affect her fertility in the future. 

As a little side information I can tell you about my experience with pregnancy and this disease.

I got pregnant before I found out I had crohns. I found out that I had crohns because the pregnancy hormone changes caused me to go into my first flare. I have a friend with crohns and 3 kids. She flared with each of her pregnancies. 

It is a toss up sometimes the disease gets better during pregnancy and sometimes it gets much worse."
"In a phase 3 there are always some ""oopsie"" pregnancies where for whatever reason people get pregnant even when they don't plan to and are advised against it. Looking at those in the Rinvoq phase 3 none of them ended up with any issues but it's obviously a small sample size.

In animal models there were issues with Rinvoq and pregnancies. They also push dosages in animals to 10x greater doses than in humans. I *think* in the animal models some at human dose showed issues but I know the rate was dose dependent.

None of that is to say Rinvoq is or isn't safe. It's more currently we just don't have the data to say definitively and we have data that says it's safe and we have data to say it's not safe. As every study ends with ""more research is needed"" before we can say either way with any level of confidence."

I don't get it. What phrase are you punning off of?
wat
There was an attempt
Huh?
A lot of words... Just for a bad pun (doesn't even work)
"Long story ending in bad (or good, depending on your pov) pun is known as a shaggy dog story. I really like them. Sadly, I don't get the reference here so joke is meaningless to me."
Tl;dr also too many notes explaining at the beginning.
"My daughter came home singing a song that sounded like ""BBL Jizzy"". I think it was written by one of three."
What the hell is BBL Jizzy?
"Lol, I Guess I am just too old for the cultural reference."
"It’s incredibly patient specific. Zoloft helped me more than anything. I’ve tried TMS, two full rounds. I’ve tried ketamine therapy and other things. But that information doesn’t do you any good. TMS may help you. It helps many people. 

If you don’t want to try Zoloft first, you’ll have to get TMS from a different provider. Some TMS clinics take all kinds of insurance. Shop around. Good luck. Hang in there."
"I'm doubtful about this ""access to unlimited infrastructure and devices"" and think that you're biting off more than you can chew. I think you should start with one study and prove you can do that well without the university's
resources before you get overly ambitious running multiple sites."
"I would look into using an e-source system, such as CRIO (not just uploading files to a Sharepoint or Florence).  It would make your site attractive to decentralized/RBM remote monitoring which saves sponsors money, may forego some in-person monitoring visits, and allows your monitors to close queries between visits which may help your query rates.  The same for using an e-reg system (and not just uploading to Florence, again)."
Adopting an all-in-one site-based technology would be my first step.  Look at CRIO if you do not already know it.
"A lot of this depends on therapeutic area. I’ve done everything from stroke studies, where you just need enough staff to be on call overnight, to phase one oncology, where you have 50+ people on any given DOA. At a small site, you’re doing everything—contracts, budgets, regulatory, patient visits, data cleaning, monitoring visits. 

I’m working with a few small sites at the moment and a pattern I’ve noticed is that they don’t know what they don’t know. Things that seem obvious—singing and dating ICFS, signing and dating DOAs, maintaining source, recording test results, timely data entry— are all issues I see regularly. 

So first I’d recommend paying a bit above market rate to ensure you get a few knowledgeable staff members. You probably know a lot, but you definitely don’t know everything. Finding another person or two with a lot of experience will help. 

Focus on quality over quantity. It’s really hard to change ingrained work habits/ culture, so it’s important to start with high standards. Invest in training newer or less experienced staff members.

I also like the recommendation of starting small. You don’t want to bite off more than you can chew and end up with a bad reputation or 483.

Also highly recommend getting familiar with sites like Veeva, Versa trials, and redcap/ advarra (if you’re doing any investigator initiated research)"
Do you have experience with contracts?
"Which therapeutic area are you looking to cover? For oncology please have HRCT, MRI, and bone scan. ECHO and MUGA is necessary as well. Basically anthing that constitutes a comprehensive health care should be there."
Yes. I’m the responsible person for our current site contracts and budgets. And I’ve worked with some huge sponsors and negotiated favorable budgets for us.
That is half the battle! Sites work so hard.  Scope of work is always expanding as trial operational plans are finalized.

Imo, the mess is too complicated for one man. It will take a BO to straighten out the tangled mess.."
"I wish we stop crucifying NP all the time, I am not denied he make many mistakes but so JL, BP, and many others as well as the previous BOD.

So far many analysis and predictions dates, posted here are wrong and so NP's. So nobody know crap until we know the end of the story.

No more fantasy goals, the table is not set yet. I hope the next trial will be the last to prove finally that LERONLIMAB is one of the best for many illness, as an investor here (LONG) I can not wait for my money back and for this drug to be use around the world. Until then I will thank NP for the amazing opportunity to be here and more if finally this company prove me I wasn't wrong all this time."
"MGK This story is almost too far fetched to make a movie out of!  I have been schooled throughout this process.  I believed the former CEO, Nader and thought we were a slam dunk with HIV per his communication.  I continue to believe we have something very special, but I also believe our stock price will be held down until we have a big name partner or produce stellar results.  It does not matter what other news comes out, as we are continually pushed down.  I would think the Pharma community world has to see the extreme potential of Leronlimab!  I know our day is coming, but it just seems to be kicked continuously down the road.  If we can't do it with this team than no one can.  Nice synopsis of our history and thank you as always for your contribution to the longs!"
"Oh MGK, what you say is so, so true. There is a huge parallel here between what has befallen Leronlimab and the present amoral/immoral state the world is in today. But honestly, I don't think those involved in attacking and hindering leronlimab necessarily disbelieve in the drug...they just don't care.

But I agree, we're in better hands now with JL at the helm. Beginning with Cyrus the moral tide has shifted, and Dr Jay's selection (and his agreeing to come on board) is reflective of that.  It'll take time, but we will reach the mountaintop where Leronlimab deserves to be."

It's sad so many people have passed away that still could be with us today..hopefully this will end soon and some DOCTORS will step up and say ""THIS DRUG IS AMAZING""....."
Religion has nothing to do with the founding of this country. They spoke of separation of church and state and freedom for all people no matter their religion. I'm not sure what that has to do with my investment anyway.
"Never bring a knife to a gun fight - I am an above average student of History - went to a school because it was named after a great president.

Our defense - Sidley Austin & Co. SO we are protecting the ball and our need is to get a first down. We will. Then we need a touch down. We will. Once we get the first TD, we will kick ass and take no prisoners. As you allude MGK, maybe the other or OUR team deflated the ball? It is our job to GET OVER IT and run them over. My rant is over - for now. Standing by."
Good weekend my friend.  R&G
I agree with RA73. I do believe in tangible items like the prospects for leronlimab because the science is there and we have evidence for it's value. Intangible human-made gods have no substance or verifiability. Morality and integrity are most assuredly not due to people having religion.
"
From the Declaration of Independence -Creator is a synonym for God.

Separation of power refers to your right to participate in the religion of your choice without interference from government. Or to choose to be an atheist. It also keeps religion from interfering with politics.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.-"
"Religion had EVERYTHING to do with the founding of this country. The Pilgrims, William Penn, Maryland, missionaries establishing churches which grew into settlements and cities, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are **endowed by their Creator** with certain unalienable rights,"" days of fasting and prayer declared by our first presidents . . . America would not have been founded by atheists because they would mock the idea of rights coming from the flying spaghetti monster, aka, God. Our creator may have (seemingly) nothing to do with the success of our investment, but He has everything to do with the founding of this country. Re: the separation of church and state, that phrase came out of a letter -one letter - from Thomas Jefferson to his cousin. The Judeo-Christian tradition defines the founding of this nation like no other nation on Earth, and we separate it from our present/past at our peril."
"For the record - If we are speaking about History, Our finest President ever was stuck on the west side of the Potomac. He had retreated there to lick his wounds. The Brits had kicked his ass from LI to where he was. It was Christmas. His troops were demoralized, freezing and starving. The plan, get across the river and attack the Hessian mercenaries in Trenton. His conscripts contract was up January 1 meaning what was left of his army might be gone. Decision made - John Glover and His Marblehead men transported ALL troops on Christmas Eve across the river. THEN they marched to Trenton - far later than planned so they lost the advantage of darkness. By divine intervention, circumstance and weather protected them from discovery. They set up at Trenton and won the battle - I believe we lost two Lads - Hessians lost hundreds. That moment is when we regained our MOJO and here we stand thanks to the Lads - Washington, his brave soldiers, the Marblehead fisherman with John Glover as leader. I would say its good to be lucky which we were but that luck on that day was Devine. We WILL win this. Standing By - Locked and Loaded"
I would agree with you but the country was formed by men who believed in a creator therefor it was a part of the founding of this Country. But I’ve met men who are atheist and honest and have integrity. And men who are hypocrites and hide behind their religion. Integrity to me is a spiritual concept not a religious concept and you can be spiritual and not have a belief in religion.
"Agree, except it does not really keep religion from interfering with politics."
Religion has nothing to do with investments in CYDY. Let's keep the religion and politics out of an investment discussion.
My creator may not be the same definition as your creator. People shouldn't state beliefs as if they are universally accepted or believed.
That’s why everybody has a choice and we live in America
"I think we understand that, but I'm not sure about those who want to think their religious beliefs should be everybody's belief even through political laws and directives. 

Love and let live,  leave it out of discussions about what's wrong with my investments."

"For a complete IRIS kidney disease staging, you need creatinine levels, SDMA, UPCR, and blood pressure."
It wouldn’t be a bad idea to see an internal medicine specialist to investigate your dog’s case further in my opinion!
"Based on just the information provided your pet is in IRIS stage 2 (barely, almost stage 1) with proteinuria. I agree and SDMA and Blood Pressure are indicated to complete the staging. Early stage 2 doesn’t usually come with clinical signs that are noticeable but that’s not a hard and fast rule. The other commenter is likely hinting at the possibility of Hyperadrenocortisicm causing the increase PU/PD, low USG, and increased ALP. 
I agree that considering other differentials is warranted given the details we have above. It is very possible that the issues you are facing are secondary to CKD Stage 2, however, like I said you usually don’t see severe PU/PD this early on and azotemia (increased creatine and bun) can be caused by non-renal factors. So there is very much a possibility that this is a non-renal azotemia secondary to a different disease that just looks like kidney disease. A follow up with your vet or internal medicine is not a bad idea if you’d be willing to continue with more diagnostics."
"Thanks. Can you say anything about the other questions (am I doing the right thing, am I doing ALL the right things, what else can I do, what can I expect (will symptoms improve or not worsen or just worsen more slowly or ...))?"
"Can you say more about why further investigations (imaging?) might be indicated (or, like, what you're getting at exactly)?"
"Thanks. The vet was quite chill about the whole thing and only very casually mentioned imaging as an option if I wanted it but he didn't say why it might be indicated or that there was a possibility of differential diagnosis (the CKD was presented as *the* diagnosis). If I had known imaging might reveal anything that would change the treatment plan and prognosis I would have gone ahead right away -- I had wondered about other possibilities myself but he sounded very certain it was simply CKD and he even said given her age he was surprised it had taken this long, that normally dogs get it younger than 14.


(FWIW He also wasn't super clear about the dietary restrictions going forward or what to expect (hence my feeling a bit clueless and posting here). I'm definitely feeling like I want more information now.)


I think I will ask for an ultrasound. "
"Ideally, you'd get the rest of the testing done and then go from there, without knowing the exact stage advice and interpretation would be premature. If you want the best care, I'd second going to see an internal medicine specialist."
I’m not allowed to hint at diagnoses on this sub as I’m not a verified user  but I think it might be worth it having a look further with a specialist to be sure not to miss anything if you have the capacity to do so. Internal medicine specialists are amazing at diagnosing and managing complex diseases and it’s possible that the ALP could be indicative of something else going on for example
CKD may very well be the true diagnosis. We are just saying there are other diseases that can cause similar signs and similar lab results. Imaging is not wrong but may not provide a definitive diagnosis either.
"The [clinicaltrials.gov](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05781750?term=palizade&draw=2) ID is NCT05781750.     

 It's a massive trial, 30+ US locations and a bunch of other countries. 

Thanks for the reference and good luck to you."
Oh and keep us filled in as things progress! I made a new post flair called Clinical Trial and assigned it to this post. Hope that's okay
Will do!

The clinical/research rift in psychology remains pervasive. Clinicians know there are many many ways - some even metaphorical! - for humans to understand their internal landscapes in order to change. IFS is simply a way to observe internal conflicts rather than get caught up in them. It will work for some people who have this problem.
"The problem with IFS isn’t that it can’t work; we simply don’t know because hardly any research has been done. The problem is that they make extraordinary claims without any evidence to substantiate them, and that’s a giant red flag. Another giant red flag is that there hasn’t been any meaningful attempt to empirically examine the intervention over the last 40 years since its creation in the 1980’s.

Contrast that with CBT, which was also developed around that time. The reason it is a well-established treatment is because its claims and concepts are falsifiable, and there have been over 2,000 studies providing a wealth of data supporting it as an effective treatment for numerous different disorders. I had difficulty finding one study on IFS, and it was a pilot study. OP was able to locate three studies. The difference in scientific rigor here is night and day. And if psychology is to be taken seriously as a *science*, we can’t in good faith contemplate interventions that have almost no scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.

So what would I like to see in terms of studies examining IFS? All of the above. Clinical observation and coding for basic theoretical concepts is needed. Factor analysis of core concepts: What are the sub-factors, and what are they related to? Are they distinct concepts, or new names for existing constructs? Qualitative data from patients (not website testimonials) about their experiences and how they are similar or different from other modalities of treatment, with thematic analysis to determine commonalities across participants. Single case experimental designs to see if functional impairment and distress actually improve meaningfully, and to what extent those improvements are durable. Systematic case studies to see whether those outcomes at least generalize across clinicians and providers.

Those are the things that should be happening first; essential theoretical work. What few studies do exist have skipped all that and gone straight to the end stages of treatment comparison before we’ve even established the validity of basic IFS concepts. Another giant red flag.

So start at the beginning, build an actual scientific foundation, and see if there is anything there at all to even compare to other treatments. Only after doing all that should we even consider studies like public health / ethnographic research, process-outcome studies, and RCT’s / efficacy trials. And then if *those* studies also support the intervention, it makes sense to carry out effectiveness trials (i.e., standardized treatment in typical community environments). Once we have somewhere around 50-100 intervention studies, then a meta-analysis makes sense. And THEN we can start making some claims about the overall effectiveness of the intervention.

But it seems the creators of IFS don’t care much for science, at least not over the past 40 years. They’d rather just claim on their website that “IFS is frequently used as an evidence-based psychotherapy” (https://ifs-institute.com/) without having done the actual work to substantiate it. This is fraudulent behavior in the scientific field. Just glancing at one of their “publications” raises even more red flags:

https://foundationifs.org/images/banners/pdf/Journal_for_Self_Leadership_DeLand.pdf

Published in the “Journal for Self-Leadership”, which doesn’t appear to be an independent journal. So they published this paper through their own journal… not normal, not independent peer-review, not scientific. Let’s look at the references… only 21 citations for a 14pg manuscript… also odd. And 16 of those citations are previous “publications” by the creator of IFS (Schwartz, R. C.)! An astounding 76% self-reference rate. This “study” is a house of cards.

Okay, so all of this *looks* scientific, and they make lots of scientific claims… but a cursory glance reveals lots and lots of unscientific process. We have a word for this in the field:

Pseudoscience"

Nothing - it simply isn't science and is fundamentally flawed. There is no reason to try and make anything out of it...blood from a stone.
You can't make a marbe sculpture from a pile of shit. The human mind is not made up of subpersonalities. A theory with this assumption fails automatically.
"This is a good response. I'm trained in IFS and use it with clients and on myself, but I don't pretend that it's somehow ""evidence-based"" nor do I hold out much hope that it will be.

I personally believe that the benefits of it are mostly (if not entirely) due to the mindfulness component and view the protocols as essentially a form of guided meditation. The concept of ""unblending"" from parts is reminiscent of the practice of cognitive defusion from ACT."
"I think to begin brainstorming, you make a great point about new language for existing constructs. I believe that this treatment could be justified as a sort of ancillary tool to existing treatment as opposed to an entire modality in that ""parts work"" already exists ad nauseum in psychodynamic/psychoanalytic circles (with shown effectiveness but lack of data on mechanism of change due to their claims of uniqueness of each provider/relationship). To integrate parts is simply not a useful treatment target in my opinion for the vast majority of people, and to artificially force a person to discover a priori parts might be damaging if done with a sense of authority, (e.g. ""science tells us you have have a firefighter part"" versus the clinician using it as an internal tool to recognize and structure treatment around experiential avoidance). The concept of recognizing and labeling thoughts which promote avoidance tendencies is already a core feature of all modern psychotherapies to my knowledge, whether that is acknowledged as a mechanism of change or not. 

In my area, there are so many therapists using IFS I feel like I could find a convenience qualitative sample quickly lol. I don't think we should underplay the level of anecdotal evidence in that way - so many people saying they've benefitted should be a sign that a real qual analysis needs to be shown in the literature. In that, I think to contrast your red flag with a green flag, the fact that IFS has gained popularity as a working tool for eating disorder clinics is especially interesting, since this population has a known relapse rate and poor prognosis. There is a mystery there - why do these clinicians find this method especially useful? Why was CBT or other models not enough? Maybe the author's marketing was amazing and it's bunk, but then again, maybe this method opens up an area for work that has real clinical use. I know that's an oversimplification but a study that explores those factors could be interesting. 

Agree with the self reference and extreme claims as pseudoscience. It does seem the author was more interested in cashing out quickly on his experience level rather than taking some mutually agreed upon steps to establish his model. I don't know why behaviorists and spiritualists can't just get along. In my mind they meld together perfectly (the observable and the mystery of internal experience) so why does one have to deny the other.

I appreciate your insight and will be saving it for future reference as a fellow skeptic of the treatment."
"How is it fundamentally flawed and what do you mean by ""it simply isn't science""?"
"It doesn't describe DID, it's more of a gestalt perspective. Have you seriously never developed a professional persona? Or experienced an inner conflict?"
"I think IFS is about noticing patterns of cognitive and emotional behavior and using a metaphor of different subpersonalities to describe them, rather than stating outright that each human has multiple distinct subpersonalities. But I could be wrong."
Both of those phenomena are better explained by valid theories...
The human mind is not divided into distinct drives. The metaphor is wrong.
"One of these theories is contextual behavioral science, which describes ""contextual selves"" and indeed has a strong research base for this. People act differently in different situations, even to an extreme degree, and their ability to do this is seen as healthy, whereas overattachment to self processes is considered often ineffective. Is it really a ""better explanation"" when it's very hard to use that info in the clinical session, and often cited as the hardest ACT process to employ? I think IFS is not an explanation per se, but a clinical tool to help clients track internal experiences and link those experiences to external phenomenon more effectively..like I already stated in my post, there is an entire study which links ifs to preexisting legitimate treatment methods at its theoretical core. What literature would you need to see to know that ifs has a theoretical tone that could indeed be valid?"
Okay. Do you have a link to some information about a more evidence based model of the human mind that I can read about? Genuinely interested.
"People act differently in different situations, because, by definition, the situation is the main determinant of behavior. ""Attribution error""."
"There are some different models depending on your specific interest and the type of model developed fits them accordingly. Taylor and Fiske have a model of a ""cognitive miser"", (""Social Cognition Theory"" might be the books name) in which the human mind is viewed as a computer more or less. Michael Billig has a metaphor for the human mind as a debate or argument that he proposed in ""Arguing and thinking"". Psycholinguists use a model that resembles a neural neutwork, Steven Pinker has written about that in his book ""Words and Rules"". 

Searching those terms will provide you with alternative sources and studies, but I would say those books are a good starting point regardless.

If you have trouble accessing any of these then send me a msg and I will make sure you can access them."
"You don't believe that in different contexts people engage thoroughly different mental models? You do realize there could be an opposite bias to attribution error, like an overestimation of external factors, maybe we can call that the ecological fallacy? If that's true, what would even be the point of talk therapy at all ...."
"Why would they engage thoroughly different  ""mental models""? Perhaps different situations call for different mental models. I will not think about shooting a basketball if I am currently typing a reddit comment. Oh nevermind, I just did while writing. Why? Because of the situation. I needed an example so I came up with one. Why basketball? Who the fuck knows.

I know about Prothagora's maxim, but you cannot overestimate external factors. By definition, means by definition. 

Talk therapy works because your interpretation of a situation can change how you view it. That doesn't mean it is more important than the situation, because the situation still fucking determines the ""mental models"" available."
"Ability to access memories (basketball) is not the same process as engaging a mental model, we're not talking about amnesiac nor tertiary dissociation. Your ability to engage a memory is not evidence of a separate mental model because they are not mutually exclusive (while playing guitar, I am engaging a significant and involved mental model of my behavior, but can still remember that I need to change the laundry). Conflating my proposal of engagement in ecological fallacy when analyzing human behavior is not Protagoras maxim and has its own unique operational definition. 

""You cannot overestimate external factors"" followed by ""your interpretation of a situation can change how you view it"" and in so result in a new behavior? Almost like internal factors can influence the external world? So it would be possible to either overestimate how much so distal external influences are impacting internal responses and vice versa?"
[removed]
"I made an argument for a claim ""Attribution error"" and you countered with a contradictory claim. Every topoi has a logoi and anti-logoi. 

Internal factors, once again by definition, cannot effect external factors. Your perception of it? Sure, but that is still stuck within the limits of ""internal"". You cannot manifest knowledge abpout psychology, you have to interact with it in hopes of attaining some.

Of course it can be overestimated, but you are not arguing anything concretely. I would once again point to the attribution error, and this time to it being labeled as ""fundamental"". Another clue.

To conclude, you can use pseudoscience all you want and use whatever concoction of delusions for pragmatic purposes. I believe I am a good person, for example."

"Dangerous nonsense.
I'm torn between saying delete this post so you stop spreading this crap or leave it up so you can be rightly ridiculed for everyone to see."
can you point me to any papers rebuking this study?
"It’s not even new. Faustman has been playing the “poor rebel outsider” and raising money from patients and families who lack the scientific literacy to evaluate the chances of success for something like a decade (if not longer). She presented her long-awaited from the first study at ADA several years back (almost getting banned in the process because she violated policies governing papers being presented), and they were underwhelming to put it mildly. 

I’ve even seen ads recruiting patients with other autoimmune conditions for BCG studies, which is borderline unethical given that no effect on autoimmunity was demonstrated in her published studies. 

While the data DID show a measurable decrease in insulin needs, I’m not sure it rises to the level of being clinically significant beyond demonstrating that making the immune system work increases non-insulin-mediated glucose metabolism, and that those effects can be somewhat durable."
Cinnamon outweighs the glaze. Works even better if you sprinkle it on top of the roll and then inhale it. Beats afrezza in lowering BG. /S

>n-stage patients are patients who have had diabetes for weeks and months…

That’s still well within the honeymoon phase for most people.

Your work sounds fascinating! Can you share more about the mathematical models you’ve developed for insulin-mediated glucose metabolism? How do these models improve the management of diabetes in closed-loop systems?

"Would love to learn more can you share more details, I don’t think you are a chump I just think that good things come when all parties work together towards a solution. I personally am of the school of thought go give it a shot so many major cures/medicines and impactful technologies happen in ways we had little to no understanding of until much later. Many were accidental discoveries so if anyone is trying anything im always curious and hopeful. I did research when I was at university years ago, and a 3 year old I love dearly was diagnosed so I’m doing research again. Her options are incredibly limited due to her age but any data helps!"
"Thank you for being in the trial, without people like you, researchers and all of us looking at, working on, and making attempts we would not progress towards a solution / cure. Hopefully with AI and data from trials like the one you participated in, the time to a cure will be drastically reduced,"
"They’re based on modeling how actual well-controlled T1Ds in real life dose their insulin, rather than strictly following the instructions and equations given by their doctors- and the radical assumption that those people actually know what they are doing.

Collecting true pivotal data is difficult, but the bulk of anecdotal reports show a reduction in time above AND below range by 30-50%, along with a corresponding reduction is standard deviation and coefficient of variation. That’s in a group of patients that already exceed ADA targets overall with regard to their glycemic management, putting them in the top ~20% of all people living with T1D, meaning there’s less room for improvement. There’s a reason that almost every pump study compares the pump against MDI- and I’ll give BetaBionics credit for having the stones to include people already using AID in their pivotal study, even if the results showed no overall improvement (and some people seeing a worsening of control) in that group. 

With a few more refinements to the model, systems based on it should be able to hit ~80% TIR running without any human input at all, and exceed 90% with iLet-style meal announcements. There’s also potential for handling exercise better, reducing the risk of exercise-induced hypos. 

All of the results so far have just been based on shoehorning the math into an existing algorithm that was already the equivalent of any commercial system. My ultimate goal is to build an entirely new algorithm from the ground up around the core equations.

Because the new math allows for better predictions as to the effects insulin will have, the system can dose more aggressively, and calculate that it’s likely safe to do so, resulting in fewer, shorter highs and fewer corresponding lows (and yes, there are limits to how high you can get and be able to come down in a reasonable time without a corresponding low). If the system gives too much insulin, or the insulin is more effective than expected due to external factors, that can be detected as well- and detected earlier, and the user alerted. “Have a snack in the next 45 minutes or so” vs sucking down juice boxes and slamming candy when the CGM alerts to the impending hypo, and winding up on a rollercoaster. 

And yes, if you’re wondering, at times I feel like I’ve done a goddamn endocrinology fellowship over the last two years working all of this stuff out, digging through the published literature, and making it fit together with the existing body of evidence and knowledge. 

For more, presentations are available online. The initial research (since refined significantly) was presented at DData In November of 2021. I’ve since done presentations at Cukrzykca Tech Fest (an online Polish diabetes tech conference), a presentation for the Loop And Learn group on FB, and a #doctalk presentation for dedoc."
"My work is in both, but I’m personally using AAPS. 🙂"
"The entire body of Faustman’s work is based on the observation that rates of T1D are lower in countries that still regularly administer the BCG vaccine. 

Ignoring alternate explanations for the observed phenomenon, she latched onto the idea that the vaccine could somehow “reset” the immune system (which any competent immunologist will tell you is NOT how things work). 

She did a study, the results of which showed a modest reduction in A1c and insulin requirements, but no restoration of natural insulin production. The overall effect is basically the equivalent of giving someone with T1D metformin.

Based on that, work along that pathway should have been redirected to identifying HOW it has that effect, rather than continuing to push the idea that it was going to somehow cure T1D. 

Instead, Faustman continues to push the idea of the BCG vaccine causing an “immune reset” or having some other immunomodulatory effect, going so far as to study using the vaccine in patients with other autoimmune diseases (the ad I saw recruiting patients was for a fibromyalgia study, and it took clicking through quite a bit to find out that she was involved). That honestly borders on unethical, as do some of her fundraising tactics (I’ve seen the emails she’s sent to people continuing to tout it as a potential cure).

Would I get the BCG vaccine if a doctor offered it to me? Sure. There’s evidence of a modest benefit and the risk is minimal. But, I’m a legally competent adult (at least, chronologically) and capable of making an informed decision. I question the ethics of continuing the research in children, and I’m honestly surprised that the research was approved.

Is there any evidence (even from Faustman) that there’s any potential for it to be a cure? The answer to that is a clear “NO.” Is it possible that the metabolic effects reduce the chances of seroconversion and the development of T1D autoantibodies? Probably. The question is by how much, and whether that potential benefit outweighs the risks and costs of the intervention. 

To take that a step further, there are likely specific genotypes (HLA-DQ1 comes to mind) that might see a greater reduction in risk, but widespread screening is not (at this point) financially realistic for society, and studies on the scale required to detect any signal in the noise and establish those correlations with any degree of certainty are probably not feasible at this point in the investigative process.

Has Faustman contributed to the overall body of knowledge? Undoubtedly. Her results actually provide some underlying evidence to support the overall grand unified theory I’m working on when viewed in the correct context. And it may be that in the future, we can identify people at elevated risk for developing T1D and reduce that risk based on her work. That, combined with things that we KNOW work to slow the progression of the disease (like Tzield and incretin mimetics) once autoantibodies develop, may significantly extend the period of time that higher-risk individuals have prior to developing clinical diabetes, but it ain’t there yet."
"Interesting. I wish there was more basic layman explanation on how to start from the ground up with AAPS. Docs are, well, *deeply* documented. Between NS, xDrip, AAPS the learning curve is insane. Most the doc libraries I know are easier to digest lol 

Out of curiosity, I got a few questions if it doesn't bother:
- what's more in the math models than insulin/carbs curves & predictions? 
- Why there's no use, that I know of, of smartwatches sensors, like fitness trackers, to include BG variation from someone doing sports?"
"The curves you see are the results of all the math and predictions, which the system then uses to determine what to do- the idea being to get to target as quickly as possible while minimizing the risk of a low. Change the math, and those prediction lines change. 

As to pulling in activity data from smartwatches and other wearables, there are people working on it, and experimental branches that are playing around with bringing it in. AFAIK, they’re not far enough along to have made it into the main dev branch for eventual inclusion into main yet, though."

"Amazing how the ARF's response to the Kremlin arresting and transferring their friends and allies in Artsakh to Azerbaijan was doubling down on helping the Kremlin. 

The best and most respected among them just got sold out by Vlad for no sensible reason and they're still doing the dirty work of forces that offer promises of a secure Armenia while securely delivering whatever they are given charge of to genocidal dictators.

I couldn't stand some of the guys that were transferred. They were idiots, our idiots, but idiots. Which is dangerous. But it turns out their friends are even dumber for abandoning them. 

As to respond to Aram Sargsyan.

>Russia will eventually withdraw fully because they are not USSR and they don't have the power to forcefully stay.

It's not that they don't have the power. They have the means and the resources. And they're petty. A reaction that hurts us is always what I'm afraid of and why I am seen here supporting a gradualism. 

But the truth is apart from bullying here or there, they just don't have the cntags, honor, or will to carry out their promises and operate on maximizing short term pursuits as if tomorrow's sun wasn't going to rise, over long-term state, trust, and influence-building."

"All you need to know about the current street protests:

  
FSB at its best.

""Notable parties and figures who joined or endorsed the ARF/Church rally: ARF's local and international structures, Serj's HHK leadership and its ""youth wing"", Kocharyan's ""Armenia"" faction MPs, the Union of Armenians in Russia led by pro-Kremlin Ara Abrahamyan, Russian-Armenian billionaire Ruben Vardanyan's Aprelu Yerkir party, the Hayaqve, Kocharyan's friend Vitaliy Balasanyan and other politicians from Nagorno-Karabakh, ex-Ombudsman Arman Tatoyan who recently participated in a forum organized by the ex-regime, an aspiring revolutionary Vazgen Manukyan, Paruyr Hayrikyan, the leadership of radical group BEVER, several MPs representing the pro-Russian opposition factions in the parliament, Mihran Poghosyan (suspected of narcotrafficking, hiding in Russia), Serj's son, Naira Zohrabyan, singers Shprot, Andre, Sofi Mkheyan, Mger Armenia, and others."""
Maybe Pashinyan resigns and chooses a successor from his party that will continue with the same foreign policy will make the protesters go home?
F eurovision though.
"It's not about Pashinyan, it's not about the policies.

It is about them being back in power, pure and simple."
"Srbazan hurt his foot walking all day and is now resting up while others do all the work. 

If that ends up being the reason the protests end, I'm going to laugh at them harder than I planned to, but they're probably going to carry around the guy in a palanquin chair or something."
"No, we all know that Kocharyan, the church, and Russia will continue its provocations until they get what they really want. I feel the main reason everyone is mentioning Pashinyan is that he is the face of Armenia’s current policies and if the leader changes but the policy stays the same you know Russia and its backers will just convince their audience to go after the new guy."
No if you don't like there are tons of other programs you can watch. This is a popular show in Europe therefore a lot of people watch and watching that is endlessly better than attending that DUMB protest.

"Not clinical, but I did the NIH nutrirional Precision study. I could not complete the second module because I was so upset with how many flaws there were. I also found it ethically uncomfortable that they had people eating so much food even if they said they were full.


I'm also a researcher though so I tend to overthink and be very nitpicky over every thing and research. Basically I do not make a great research participant. 


I think when I was an undergrad there was a research institution in the college town I was in but I just never had time to do them.


I really do hope that more Black people and women get involved in clinic research because we definitely need representation in the science.

Hi! Totally understand. Let me know if you have any questions. I’m not conducting a survey or study. I’m a journalist.
"I'm a journalist for a Black media outlet, so I'm gathering perspectives on what Black folks think about clinical trials, especially after Covid and our other reasons to mistrust the medical industry at large."
"In the context of the rule, there’s really no difference between a journalist conducting interviews and an academic conducting a study. Next time please contact us beforehand."
"I see. My perspective is skewed because I studied public health and was a healthcare researcher for years before my current profession. I wouldn’t say I have mistrust in the industry at large knowing the crazy amount of bureaucracy that goes into these trials. Covid was a once in a lifetime global event and I understand why they had to move fast. 

Clinical trials in general suffer from a lack of promotion to underrepresented groups. Honestly they need to pay more so that there’s more data on how things affect people like us. "
"Idk about Canada but most places in America give you zero support, so if it's anything like here you'll just have to figure it out yourself anyways."
"No not worth it. Sleep doc was useless. The only reason I’m successful is the apneaboard forum and the YouTube channel The Lanky Lefty 27. Check out both. The guy who has the YT channel runs his own sleep business, I can’t think of his actual title off hand."
"No it's not worth it, head over the apneaboard forum and install and SD card into the machine, I self titrate and it's saved my life :)"
Resmed 10 machine models do everything the model 11 does but does not advise the Doc of your usage compliance via its modem.  The model 10s cost about $U400 to 500 bought online from CPAP or CPAPX or CPAPSUPPLIES or LOTA on line.
"It's probably more worthwhile to be more invested in your own care and figure out how to do the adjustments yourself.  Airsense 10: you hold the radial dial and home buttons for a few seconds to enter the clinician's menu.  Airsense 11: Hold the two large square buttons on the touchscreen for a few seconds to do the same.  Once there, you can play around with the pressure all you like.

Setup isn't that particularly difficult.  Your clinic will be very unlikely to be of any useful help.  There are many communities (here, apneaboard, cpaptalk, etc) that can help you get started.

Clinics here (in canada) are a fucking racket.  They're only trying to make a markup by referring you to buying machines that should be priced nowhere near what they should be selling it for."
"If you are buying a ResMed, you will probably use the Auto CPAP function (because Resmed's is pretty great) and never actually need to adjust it.

If you need to adjust it, you can do it yourself using these instructions:

https://www.apneaboard.com/resmed-airsense-11-setup-info

Having said that, the adjustment challenge is knowing what to adjust it to.  The therapist may be useful for identifying changes, but since you are looking at the ResMed, it will likely be set to Auto 5-20 and never touched again."
Where I Canada because Ontario Ohip covers 75% of a basic machine remed 11 what I got with an upgraded mask cost me 509$ I don’t have private insurance
"Get the 10. It is tried and true. Follow Nick at CPAP Reviews or Jason at TheLankyLefty27, both on YT on how to self optimize one's treatment using OSCAR or Nick's SleepHQ. Oscar is free https://www.sleepfiles.com/OSCAR/

Seen online pricing card to cloud in the CAD$800 range. Heated tube is recommended.

Check pricing at Sleepeh.ca cpapoutlet.ca monstercpap.ca cpapmachines.ca cpapsupply.ca sleepyeti.com (Calgary I think).

Card to cloud model is cheapest for the 10. Modem model costs a bit more, but allows u to use Myair app. OSCAR uses SD card."
I love my 10.  No reason to buy the newer model.
If you have no issue doing trial and error and are fine with making adjustments get the 10. You can get an SD card and save your data that way.
Adjustments are free.
If you’re still having problems check out apneaboard forum on the web and The Lanky Lefty 27 on YouTube. Without both of them I wouldn’t be were I am today. I told my doc everything they told me and she ignored it all. Haven’t been back since and chugging along nicely every night:
Agree 100%
"In Alberta.  I tried looking into government coverage… there is a way but many hoops to jump through to get it, it’s time consuming and still not guarantee you get it"
"Awesome thank you!  Since the 11 does not have the card, does that mean I would not be able to use OSCAR? Or does it send the data wirelessly"
"11 should have its own a SD card. If not, u should can get any SD card, 1GB or larger. 11 has some issues like poor humidifier tank design...hard to use if u have arthritis. It is easy tip over. 10 has a swivel tube connector which I luv. 11 has issues with its tube connector...see Nick's vids."

"Currently on the trial in Australia, it’s the best thing ever & really works unbelievable
I’ve lost nearly 15kg in 10weeks"
The part that annoys me is that all the trials I find are for conditions other than T2D or you have to have T2D and be obese. Weird to not have switchers as a test cohort that are at normal weight.

Stock tanks on good news. Love it
"Sweets for the sweets, sugar for the honey!!!

Can it get any sweeter as Zomedicas TRUFORMA, TRUVIEW, VetGuardian, the Artificial Intelligence, and more new assays sell in the United States and now Europe!!!  We are going to be rich.  This is the best quarterly ever!!!

GameStop did it, and so can we... after all, people may love their games, but they love their pets more.  GameStop was headed for bankruptcy' then out of nowhere they took off and millionaires were made.  Zomedica is doing great and doing what's expected.

They have more than proven themselves, and now, at this point, all they have to do is sell, manufacture and distribute, and keep up appearances... to the Moon, and good job Larry and his team!!!"
"9 million total outflow, 3 million cash.  6.3m revenue, 3 million cash.  Either way, they need to start making money soon."
"This isn’t good news.  More revenue but increasing debt and now only $91 million liquid.  That sucks. 
They are burning $9 million a quarter now.  It was $6 million a quarter."
"My guy. This is nothing like GameStop. Far from it. Just because a company has products the investors like doesn’t mean the buyers like it. They literally cannot give away truforma. The vomiting and diarrhea panel? Maybe if the veterinarian doesn’t have eyes to see the excrement and ears so they can’t listen to the owner it would be helpful. Maybe expansion into Europe would be cool if anyone gave a shit about the products. Fun fact, idexx has been in Europe and Asia for about 3 years now, they give away their analyzers as well for a volume commitment. They also do wayyyy more than vomiting and diarrhea, can run up to 24 chemistry assays on one run and sample of blood. Just because zom is now allowed to sell overseas doesn’t mean they will. Idexx has spent hundreds of millions to develop that market and the likes of zomedica aren’t going to even create a wave over there. Your shark, Larry doesn’t want in that pool, his pockets are not nearly deep enough and there isn’t any revenue to make it worth their while. So they rely on a dying breed of distribution reps to push their shit and not get paid for pushing it….good luck everyone. The thought of even breaking even at this point is hilarious."
100million liquidity balance down to 91million
"So, their current runway is well under 1 year now.

Guess they'll start looking to extend their runway, fairly soon, if they haven't already started."
"The last smile it seems will be IDEXX as Zomedica enters Europe with the only animal analyzer that detects the lowest frequency on the planet using BAW technology.  TruForma has 201 patents and 61 patents pending that will protect our state-of-the-art analyzer and no one can copy it.  If you do not have Bulk Acoustic Wave in an analyzer, then you don't have an analyzer that is the most reliable!!!

PulseVet however is the reason we will hit 50 million in revenue which is what we need to make profit and soar, and we are almost there.  The rest of the products is the gravy... Go get' em Larry.  Europe is waiting!!!

Keep in mind that no matter what happens we never vote yes to a reverse split, this is how you get rich is by owning a large number of shares... to the 2025 Moon!!!

PS:  IDEXX is giving all their analyzers away for free just like Zomedica is.  Analyzer's main source of income is through the ongoing revenue generated through the sale of the cartridges!!!  So, we are not the one's giving an analyser away for free... everybody's doing it, and if their not, they better!!!"
I’m an elf from a little village. Forgive me.. what does “current runway” mean ? lol
Can you please point to the studies and white papers proving the most reliable and accurate baw tech? To blindly state it’s the most reliable and accurate without proof is at best poor judgement on your part.
Time before their cash runs out since they are operating at a loss and burning cash reserves
"The burden of proof is yours, but seeing's how you do so much by getting back to us here on Reddit with all you see out there in the animal health industry' I can at least do some research again, and to my dismay' I worded it wrong. 

Because BAW operates at a high frequency, it has a very LOW LIMIT of detection allowing these changes to be measured down to fewer than 10 picograms per milliliter.

I had read somewhere BAW is the lowest limit of detection, but until I find that info. wherever it might be, I will restrict my comment to low limits and not the lowest on the planet, and that's good enough don't you think?  You're keeping me sharp' I'll give you that!!!  But BAW is great technology, and we are the only animal analyzer that houses this concept... to the USA Moon and the European!!!"
We will hit profit by the end of 2025.  But by some chance we do not then we will soon.  Zomedica is too big now not to be successful.
"I’m not the one spouting this being the greatest tech because of xy or z with no proof. I’m asking you for the proof to prove the point that until there is public information about the accuracy and reliability of this tech in veterinary medicine we don’t know exactly shit. This is science we’re talking about and the proof is found thru the fundamentals of the scientific process. And having the lowest threshold for measurements isn’t really relevant. There are reference ranges for a reason and measuring in ug/pg doesn’t change anything other than the unit of measurement. An out of range assay is out of range regardless of the unit. Being the only analyzer with this tech isn’t necessarily a good thing. If it’s soo great why is zomedica the first to pick it up for their suite of equipment? Why not any of the other companies? If it’s so great they would have seen the potential for it years ago and created their own version or bought this one. 

Your rosy colored glasses are fogging up your ability to think in a remotely logical manner."

"No idea what your work environment and culture are like, but if you're the new guy, it might be hard to get away with saying no to being asked to support a project. I would just go along with it and look at it as an opportunity to learn something new, especially if there's going to be other technical staff on the project (so the burden won't fall entirely on you) and your compute is sufficient to deal with the data you have, so you can focus on the methods rather than on hacky workarounds."
"I’m a biostatistician who did dissertation work on ML methods, and worked on some medical imaging (radiology) data projects in grad school. 

If you already have the data, and can understand GLMs, then this won’t be hard at all for you to pull off. The actual ML model-fitting task is in many ways, easier and less rigorous than what we are traditionally used too. It’s pretty fun too. Just dip your toes into it. 

Many of these so-called ML methods were developed by biostatisticians and statisticians specifically for high dimensional data. Statisticians wrote “elements of statistical learning” - not data scientists. 

However, if your job is to clean and process raw imaging data, or to make a ML model that can pushed “to production” (like you’re making an app), then you’re going to need some new programming skills that many data scientists have but we aren’t trained for. 

If they want you to use neural networks like CNNs or transformers, this is a very expensive and time consuming task - not necessarily harder, but you and your employer should take this into consideration. 

In general, I would be more concerned about a ML engineer or data scientist having to properly run a survival analysis involving multiple imputation than a statistician doing ML."
"Honestly, I think it's time you step up. You've previously mentioned that you have a MSc and >5 years experience. You have the tools to learn and to educate yourself in order to accomplish what you need to. You're being asked to apply n existing method(s) not develop a new ML model. 


Now it is reasonable to say you aren't familiar with these methods and will require additional time to get up to speed. It is also reasonable to not be interested in that type of work, but if that is the case then perhaps you're not the right person for the role. However, you are more than qualified to learn on the job."
"Don't worry about the details for the machine learning models (you can just think of them as the predict function for a lm), but use your statistical thinking to see if there are ways you can add context about uncertainty or employs clever design for improving the efficiency of the studies."
Enroll in OMSCS at GT or MSCSO at UT Austin part-time to know more about machine learning and computer science.
That sounds reasonable. Thanks a lot for your advice!
Fully agreed. Thank you!
"I will try my best! I just hope the sample size is large enough (yet to be discussed and maybe simulated a priori). I keep thinking of the new TRIPOD-AI guidance and hope I am up for it.

Appreciate your input!

Edit: I am also worried if R will suffice since I have no experience with Python."
For whatever method you're implementing there is almost certainly a package in both R and python that will do it. And if there isn't it's a good opportunity to more learn python.

"Omg Liss! I have hEDS, MCAS, POTS, autism, and ADHD. It took me 15 years and a mess of misdiagnoses to get my diagnoses and care. I’m currently disabled and just try to make art, music, and take care of plants when I can. The mess of navigating illnesses that don’t show up on tests and being medically gaslit is exhausting.

I’m so sorry there are so many of us out here struggling to find a balance and some semblance of quality of life. I’m so proud of you for taking the time you need to recover and try to come up with a game plan for living as healthily as possible!"
Love you Liss!! We are always here for you! 💜💜
We'll keep you around SPG every way possible that's for sure!
"This resonated with my own medical history, and now with having to deal with figuring out why my arms hurt all the time…… I wish you the best for your work/life/health balance! 

Btw, I just started the process of getting a GIA GG, so if you’re ever feeling up to answering some questions I’d love to hear more about your experiences!"
"I'll echo Michelle in that you're loved out here in the interwebs, dear Liss! Thank you so much for sharing such personal stuff - and much empathy from the land of the health struggle bus! (albeit a smaller bus over here)  



Absolute 10000% the most important thing is you and your health - it's easy to put ourselves last, and/or forget about mental and emotional etc. health too. 

  
We're all lucky to have you, in whatever capacity works best for you! Even if it's simply in the form of posts now and again!!

And apologies for being a chronic over-emailer by the way, omg :/"
"*waves the zebra flag from the fellow spoonie corner* 

You’ve got way more support and fellowship then you’d ever realize, from the looks of the thread! The internet opened so many doors for us chronic illness folks, and even helps us wear our “I’m fine! Nothing is wrong with me!” masks when we’d like to pretend just a little bit longer that we have energy we probably don’t actually have. 

Your work is wonderful, and your spirit and love for this subject and community shines through whenever you are able to join and share with us! We appreciate all the work you’ve done, and energy you’ve poured into this, and Jim and the team are lucky to have you. 🥰 

Take it easy. Join us when you can. Lurk when you don’t have the energy to even be perceived. And snuggle into the offline cocoon as much and as long as need be. We will still remember your name and your wonderful personality when you do make it back. 

It’s hard to be gentle with yourself. But you deserve to feel better. And for more than just an hour or two. Proud of you for re-tooling your needs scale so it’s more accurately balanced."
Take care of yourself!! 💕🫂
"Thank you so much for taking the time to update us. We're so lucky to have you, and we truly don't deserve you. Rest up and feel better so you can come back in your own time and on your own terms. You'll be welcomed back with open arms. 🫂"
"Be strong, Liss. Speaking from experience, trying to get a medical professional to LISTEN and take a person seriously is so very frustrating. Years ago, I came down with a strange rash that looked like a mild case of chickenpox and itched so bad I was tearing up my skin. Dr said I had “zits”( on my back, legs and stomach?) and “needed to wash better”. Three weeks later, as the last few pustules started to dry up, it came back twice as bad. Dr said I had Scabies, I told him that I have had scabies and this was not it. As the last few pustules on this round started to dry up, it came back AGAIN with a vengeance. Dr took pictures and sent to a Dermatologist who said he had “no clue”. Dr shrugged and said “ can’t help you” and walked out. I went through these outbreaks every early summer for 3 years, each episode worse than the last. I have a degree in Microbiology and have a microscope, so decided to do my own research. I isolated a spirochete, did hours on hours of research on the American dermatology society website and found a disease/ infection that matched my symptoms. But I needed a prescription for the medication to treat it, so I went back to my doctor. When I told him about what I had found, he got angry, livid actually, with me, threw the printout across the desk without even reading it, and told me how very tired he was of “House syndrome”( named after the TV show with Hugh Laurie). Told me that “ when you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras”. I told him that I was sure at this point that we have ruled out horses. They say that it takes over 7 years and more than 7 -8 doctors before someone with a non- common condition/disease/ syndrome gets a valid diagnosis. Sorry, truly didn’t mean to high jack your post. Don’t give up, do your own research because after your 20 minutes in the exam room are over, you and your problems are gone from the Doctor’s mind as if you never existed. Wishing you the best outcomes."
Thank you for sharing your story!
"heds with with a bunch of extras, thanks for talking about it!"
Love you.  You’ve always been such an amazing asset here and are very loved.
Take care of yourself first!! We'll still be here
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So smart to step back and get things in balance. Good for you!! From a fellow EDSer I wish you all the best!
Take care of yourself Liss! Many thanks for everything you’ve done for the community and your incredibly kind and patient emails.
"Liss, 

Thank you for your bravery in sharing your story. Thank you for supporting SPG in all of the ways that you have! Sending you tons of positivity for a quick healing journey."
"Your honesty and vulnerability are much appreciated 💜 Thank you for all you have done for us (and me, personally!)"
I have POTS - sisters in symptoms
Take care of yourself Liss! ✨✨
"Thank you so much for sharing some of your journey with this community! I had the privilege of working with you on a setting for my first SPG purchase from u/mvmgems, and you were as kind and helpful as I could possibly have hoped. May you find more clarity re: diagnoses and treatments, and I'm glad you're part of a community that allows you to be all of you."
"Hey Liss thank you for sharing your story. I'm glad you feel you can ask for help and are getting the help you need. 


I'm glad you're not suffering in silence. The people who care about you, who really matter, WILL want to help you. If someone labels you attention seeking / making others cater to you / being a burden, they are not worth your time, fuck them! It took me way too long to ask those close to me for help, and that's when I realized I had been putting my energy and effort in the wrong people, while those who really care and wanted to help just never knew. Love yourself! And let the trash take themselves out!"
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please take care of yourself! This whole community is behind you! Nothing is more important than health ❤️

"Liss you are amazing! Take care of yourself and we’ll all be here whenever you feel like coming by. Love you girlfriend! 

From the Dragon who is still dealing with complicated grief, and some new health issues herself."
"Liss, you are a boss babe! Sounds like you been knocked down again and again but you continue to get up and hold your head up high. Take the time you need rest, recover, and snuggles with your animals. As you hold your head up high let this subgroup of all the pretty shinies straighten your crown. Might be a crazy thought, have you thought about going to a medical school? Some medical schools might do a live case study, for nursing we had act like we had a certain disease (so we had to figure out the symptoms and portray them to the class and they had to guess what it was) this was a way we could learn to recognize certain things so we could help treat people. I wonder if a medical college has something similar but they use real people that have medical disorders/diseases. Maybe a group of not quite yet doctors have an idea that you could try? Food for thought."
We love you Liss! Thank you for making this community what it is. I am so proud of you for doing what you need to take care of yourself ❤️. We will be here when you are ready!
"(((((Gentle hugs))))), and keep being you. Being a spoonie is so darn hard, hour by hour. I'm learning (15 years in) to advocate for myself better, which is so hard when we have been brought up to be agreeable and respectful. 

Keep going, Sister Liss. We've got your back."
Oh my goodness. You've been so patient with me as I've wandered through the  Land of Indecision.  I'm so glad you are taking care of yourself.
Take all the time you need!  We miss you but your health comes first!
We love you Liss!  Your health comes first!!!!
"Take all the time you need, Liss. We’re all rooting for you"
"I had pseudotumor cerebri when I was 16 as well. But mine was due to an allergic reaction to minocycline (commonly prescribed for acne). 

I also have endo, fibromyalgia, and hEDS to name a few. Chronic pain and chronic illness is so draining physically and emotionally."
We love you! Thanks for all you've done for our community. Please take care of yourself ❤️❤️❤️
"Oh wow, please take care of yourself and start feeling better soon!"
"Shiny rocks can wait around forever, but heath is transient. Thank you for your service in this sub, and best of luck!"

"Oh yes, the trifecta! I swear, the moment doctors suspect hEDS they should immediately test for autonomic dysfunction and MCAS. But it is tough when the diagnostic criteria literally is ""rule everything else out.""

There need to be more options out there than the standard 9 to 5, because we can absolutely contribute to society. But we need a bunch of naps, five pounds of salt and our Ritalin prescriptions to be filled on time!"

Lol one condition was that you were still hers in email! I should say her conditions not that I didn't want you lol!
"I'm really terrible at managing my own limitations (shocker) but I am trying to be better! Luckily I have a devoted husband to yell at me when I'm not hydrating enough or working too hard. He may not have any experience with my level of medical insanity but he goes off and does his own research and supports me when I finally concede that I should go to the ER.

I'll be doing lots of lurking, and hopefully bit by bit get back to being social again. Us zebras have a habit of disappearing from the world when we are struggling but I do miss my gem family <3"
"Y'all made my life so much better when I was in a really tough place, don't think for a moment that you aren't a blessing <3"
"I have a great respect for the amazing doctors that have helped me figure (most) things out. But I also am a firm believer that patients need to be their own best advocates. Sadly they are just as human as we are, and they don't have all the information that we have. But enough stubbornness and patience can get results!"

Woooooo weirdly bendy gang unite!
Let's take a stand against POTS! \*faints in unison\* :D
"Right?! It’s insane how similar we all are/the chain reaction autoimmune issues cause.

I keep saying that if I weren’t required to work a specific number of hours or set time to do tasks, I would be great! I get interested in so many things, and I love to be busy or create. I just can’t do it consistently.

If the many different types of people that should just be able to exist and contribute to society “differently.” The world would be so much more beautiful. All of those master artists we know by name? Most of them made art full time. It’s a fantastic avenue for the chronically ill. Arts should have more public support. Chronically ill people should have more support 😅

If you haven’t checked out the musician Ren Gill, take a look! He has Chronic Lime, ME/CFS, and MCAS. He writes a lot of music about it and talk about his journey a lot. He just offered me a lot of solace. Especially since he’s the one who led me to the possibility of MCAS. It’s simultaneously nice and horrible to know that we aren’t alone."
😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Hahahaha!! Aw geez you guys! You're going to have me weeping all over my keyboard in a minute! (that being said, I'd absolutely not blame you a bit for being horrified at the thought of having to take over managing me! lol)

"Remember that zebras disappear best in a herd. 🥰 Let the people you love, and who love you in return, support you in the ways you need. We make each other stronger, so getting better is for BOTH your benefit and the benefit of those around you. 

Something a fellow spoonie taught me was to make a “down for the count” list. Whenever I’m zapped and need to retreat to my nest, I can share the note with my partner. It’s got a list of my usual household responsibilities (like laundry, or vacuuming) plus a few other things that I’d likely want to contribute to helping with but know I likely won’t be able to for at least a little bit. 

If anyone offers to help, he refers them to the list. They can pick something off of it, and know they’re taking something off my plate that I’m otherwise lying in bed feeling guilty about. Plus, it reminds my partner of the things that will need a little extra attention while I’m not able to tend to them so things don’t turn into a surprise problem. It’s been really helpful!"
"The sad thing was that the doctor, who by his own admission,  had no idea what was going on with my health, would not even LOOK at the documentation I presented and in fact, actually THREW it across the desk while berating me. Yes, they are human and therefore can make mistakes. But as you pointed out above, I DO have more information about me and my situation than he  and i have more “skin in the game”.  He wasnt the one looking like a leper with hundreds of horribly itching, open sores weeping yellow pus. People were staring at me in the grocery store and would put distance between us just in case what I had might have been contagious . I am covered with scars as a results. Since my money had bought me 20 minutes of his time and I still had 10 minutes left, what would have been the harm in just looking at what I had found?"
I’ve been saying that for years😂especially with the truly awful drs in my area

"Firstly, I’m sorry for your diagnosis. Good news (as my doctor told me in 2011 when I was diagnosed): there are a lot of TKIs. Is rare to get resistance from one TKI but in case you have it, you can switch to another TKI. Also, clinical trials are necessary, so no worries: you will get examined very often."
"I'm a 32 year old male and was diagnosed a year ago and I'm participating in this trial. There is no certainties that the others will work if this one fails. Asciminib binds differnt, so other tkis should be an option. There's always that risk tho. Ask every question you can think of and if your gut says no then don't. With that being said I'm doing excellent and wouldn't even know I had leukemia. No side effects for me. Any questions feel free to ask."
"Hey!  first, im sorry to have to  welcome you to the CML club. :( 

i got diagnosed back in 2012. Ive tried a couple of the meds, and i know several other CML patients as well, so Imma be straight up with you.

so with asciminib,  its been reported that most have said the side effects are actually not as bad as it is on others.  Its hard to say how it will do on you, because each person reacts differently to each TKI.  For example, Sprycel was HELL on me. I was on it for several years as well. While its the WORST for me, someone else does fine with it. One person didnt even have side effects on sprycel. 

If asciminib doesnt work out for you, then yes you could change to sprycel, tasigna, etc etc. I have been offered to take asciminib. I wanted to jump on it, but then i had some health issues so i stayed on tasigna because most of the issues was stomach problems and we didnt want to start a new drug and not know why exactly im sick or whatnot. \\

I know one of the first people to be on asciminib. shes soooo freaking awesome! She failed all the other meds. Asciminib saved her life. ""at that time it was known as ABL001 in trial""

Im very lucky and blessed that my CML specialist is one of the top in the field. he was even part of the development of sprycel, and he wants to switch me to it as soon as im ready. 

So i would  say, Go for it. It may be  the best one for you."
"Hey! I'm 26M...was diagnosed with CML back in 2012 and since I've been on all other TKIs and my cells became resistant to each one of them overtime. Asciminib on other hand has been the only one that's working for me, with surprisingly no side effects (depends on individuals I guess). It's the safest medication I have used for CML personally. Living with CML could be hard but you get used to it and like discussed in a previous post, it becomes the new normal."
Oh also. I switched from sprycel because I had joint pain in my elbows and had some low key fatigue that got annoying. I have joint pain still on ascinimib but I’m hoping it goes away in the next few weeks. I switched meds because I heard good reviews of ascinimib and I thought it would be good to try something different.
"I was diagnosed 6  weeks ago, and just started Sprycel, so I can't possibly give an informed opinion. What I do recommend is asking your oncologist these questions about resistance and switching, and making sure you get a satisfactory answer. I've started writing down my questions in advance so I don't forget about them.  If you can't switch to a different class of TKI if this one doesn't work, I'd be wary."
I got diagnosed 3 years ago and was on sprycel up until a month ago when I switched to ascinimib. The 80mg dose made me incredibly sick with diarrhea and fatigue. They switched me to 40mg now and I seem to be handling it much better.
"People have answered already. So I'll just add a comment. You're young and there are many options for drugs, you'll likely be just fine. The hardest part for me was just navigating insurance which I was new to."
"Sorry for your diagnosis. 
I don't know about your location, but my doctor referred to a scientific paper (i will try to find it), where there was a correlation between clinical trials and survival over time. The paper describes that clinical trials often lead to more thorough check ups and therefore earlier intervention of other issues that might occur during a lifespan. 
This paper referred to American healthcare, but i think it can be true for most. I would really recommend clinical trials, I've joined a few and I feel well cared for and I even have a phone number I can call if I have questions between appointments, that is connected to the trials."
"I asked the doctor that very question when my sister was getting ready to choose between a clinical trial or sprycel. His answer was that answer was something to learn from the clinical trial. The clinical trial hadn’t started around her hospital yet and she would have had to travel a much further distance to participate, so she choose sprycel. She is doing amazing on sprycel. Fatigue is her biggest and really only side effect. Good luck making a decision. Don’t stop asking questions. Good luck with your treatment."

When out for us to use? Timeline
"So, this is relatively “new news” and became recent understanding among research teams. Even few years back most researches would only focus on recovery of IHC/OHC but ignore synapses. Now, they realize that without synapse formation you having or missing on IHC/OHC is same because nothing would connect them to nerve bundle. Essentially you may be getting tinnitus not just because of OHC/IHC damage but because of damage/loss of synapses. Technically brain won’t loose connection to OHC/IHC because if synapse is intact then connection still remains intact, just sensitivity to frequency is worse. In our case with tinnitus we not only loosing IHC/OHC due to damage, but Synapses as well. If someone could recover synapses- we could potentially get rid of tinnitus but won’t recover hearing fully. If you want actual cure - then IHC/OHC and synapses must be recovered.

I believe Dr. Cheng is making a progress towards both IHC/OHC + Synapse regeneration via gene expression. He did achieve successful trial in Shanghai with kids whom were born deaf due to gene mutation, which is not the same as hearing damage, but it is encouraging nonetheless."
Hope it goes somewhere
"I have hearing loss and tinnitus in my left ear since I was a child due to some ear infections, will this work for me?"
"What about for those of us without hearing loss? I’m beginning to feel like we are the forgotten. And yes, I’ve tested. Multiple times."
"Dude, if a lobotomy would fix tinnitus I’d be in line."
God Speed
"25 years ago, the ATA said there will.be a cure for tinnitus soon. Where the hell is the cure?"
Saw this the other day- https://apple.news/ALM9IRIrGTcqEnUBz_bjVBQ
"Synapses and Hearing:

The synapse is a critical junction where nerve cells (neurons) communicate with each other.

In the context of hearing, synapses connect the inner hair cells (IHCs) in the cochlea (the spiral-shaped part of the inner ear) to the auditory nerve fibers.
When sound waves reach the cochlea, IHCs convert them into electrical signals, which are then transmitted via synapses to the auditory nerve.

Tinnitus and Synaptic Damage:

Tinnitus is the perception of ringing or buzzing in the ears without any external sound source.

Synaptic damage can disrupt the connection between IHCs and the auditory nerve.

If synapses are damaged, there may be no communication between the nerve bundle and IHCs.

This disruption could indeed be a leading cause of tinnitus because the brain receives abnormal signals or experiences a lack of input due to damaged synapses.
Importance of Recovering OHC/IHC and Synapses:

To address tinnitus and hearing loss, it’s crucial to focus on both:

Outer hair cells (OHCs): These cells amplify sound signals and contribute to our ability to hear soft sounds.
Inner hair cells (IHCs): These cells directly transmit signals to the auditory nerve.

Synapses: Repairing damaged synapses is equally important because they facilitate communication between IHCs and nerves.

Recovery of both OHC/IHC and synapses is essential for restoring hearing and potentially alleviating tinnitus.
Cochlear Implants and the 16KHz 

Spectrum:
Cochlear implants are electronic devices that can help people with severe hearing loss or deafness. While current cochlear implants work well, they don’t fully replicate natural hearing. The idea of an implant that connects to nerve bundles more naturally and reproduces the full 16KHz spectrum (a wide range of frequencies) is exciting.

Such an advanced implant could significantly improve hearing quality and potentially address tinnitus as well.
In summary, understanding and repairing synapses are crucial steps toward treating tinnitus and restoring hearing. The development of innovative cochlear implants remains a promising avenue for future advancements in this field"
Also fluid in the ears damage or ear infections
God please
Might need an investigation? Who knows....
It’ll be ready in 10+ years if it doesn’t fail.
"There are a myriad of root causes to tinnitus, not just one. Not just 5, or even a dozen. 

When a small percentile of tinnitus sufferers finds some relief, it's false hope to the rest of us who do not suffer from the same type of tinnitus as those who benefited. 

They're going to need a lot more research to be able to properly solve/cure it for any significant portion of tinnitus sufferers. 

I'm not holding out hope, because there's no profit in it for anyone to cure or treat tinnitus. Heck, Type-1 diabetes has been around for decades and millions of people are impacted by it, and they haven't found a cure (though some treatments are promising, with donor islet cells and closed-loop monitoring), but those 'treatments' are what generates the profit. As long as healthcare and the medical/pharma industry has a means to extract a profit, they will. 

There is no such analogue with tinnitus, other than selling dead-end medical tests, expensive masking devices and hearing aids."
You know that nerves heal themselves right? And no its not big part of the problem. The big part of the problem is loud sound damage to the cochlea / hair cells where the inner ear muscles failed to protect the cochlear against loud noise exposure.
"You are not wrong, but understanding of hearing issues in 2012 equal almost 0 and a lot of things were learned since the , I’d like to say especially in the past 4-5 years really. In the past 2 years the whole “hearing issues” related research really picked up because currently estimated affected population with hearing loss is 1.5billion and by 2035 it is estimated to double. Do your math."
"I mean technology has advanced a lot since 10 years ago, plus it’s in higher urgency because more and more young adults and veterans are experiencing it, plus even big researchers from Harvard, Stanford and other companies around the world have gotten a bigger idea while researching over the last few years, it’s been widely known that regenerating hair cells/hearing loss has been on the horizon. I’ve seen articles recently of kids regaining hearing from genetic hearing loss, so eventually they’ll pull through with a way to treat noise induced hearing damage & hair cell loss. tinnitus has had some research also but it’s just more complex."
Flying cars
Lol
Well don’t count on con man Elon Musk and Neuralink. Their first implant has run into problems.
I don't have a clue. After phase II it has to go through phase III.
"He’s been researching all kinds of hearing loss, especially the one caused by damage to the hair cells"
"Absolutely!

Edit:  I have no clue dude."
Also how do you cope with it since you've had it for so long? I've always had bad hearing but I could still enjoy things until I got tinnitus 2 months ago.
"Possibly, the infection could have caused damage in this area that is believed to cause tinnitus. Therefore something to regenerate the area somehow would have a chance if the theory is correct."
"I did a test as well and she told me my hearing was “within normal levels”, but then I read a comment here saying that they had received the same kind of response but discovered hearing loss after testing with higher frequencies. 

I certainly feel like I hear worse than people in my age cohort. Do you know if you tested for higher frequencies as well?"
ATA is money laundering organization.
Where did they say that?
Where are you getting that timeline?
"While I agree that there are many root causes of tinnitus, majority do share same root cause which is damage/loss of OHC/IHC and/or Synapses. I don’t agree with what you saying regarding the fact that there is no profit in treatment and cure ? I mean you have 1.5B people with hearing loss around the globe and there is very little to no option for these people. Companies know that this is literally a GOLD MINE with infinite market value because human population is constantly exposing themselves to noise and what was thought to be and “elderly problem” is now becoming a lot younger and now is being seen in middle aged people more often. It is estimated that 1.5B number will turn in to 2.5B+ by 2035. Even if cure is found - don’t think that they won’t have “returning” clients, because people will keep damaging their hearing after recovery and keep going back (at very least military people, law enforcement, people that work at loud factories and etc). I understand that you might of lost hope but you just need to be realistic and while yes there is nothing available now, it does not mean that companies are not interested in finding some sort of solution."
Part of the problem is that humans don’t have ability to regenerate hearing like non-mammals do due to gene suppression after certain point before birth. Hence lack of ability to regenerate damage to OHC/IHC and Synapses. If somehow that gene could get turned back on - it would rebuild what was damaged according to hosts DNA.
Need to get healthcare out of the corpo nightmare it is in. Part of the reason things run so slowly is so they can examine how to maximize all profits too before they begin.

"If synapses gets damaged - there is no connection between nerve bundle and OHC/IHC, therefore it could be the leading cause of tinnitus. In my opinion it is crucial to be able to recover both OHC/IHC and Synapses to them in order to recover hearing and get rid of tinnitus.

Unless someone comes up with such cochlear implant that connects to nerves bundle almost naturally and being able to reproduce whole 16Khz spectrum."
"My tinnitus was really low, but now it got louder because of some noise ..."
"I mean, it's hearing loss, you can't regenerate rearing *yet*"
I’ve lost higher frequencies but it’s normal parameters for my age group.

"It’s the ATA.

They’ve been trying to cure tinnitus for how many years? It’ll always be “5 years from now”
"Just to preface: I’m just a guy with no real qualifications to talk about any of this (I don’t even live in the US), but:

While I agree with you on the fact that there are potentially massive gains to be had, the impression that I have is that because of the short-term focus of healthcare providers that are listed on the stock market, and because of the inherent risk of a potential treatment failing after having spent a lot of money on it, there might be an understanding that while there is money to be made, no one is really willing to «take the leap».

What do you think?"

Sorry to hear that. I got my tinnitus from neglectful american fire alarm policy. It's way unnecessary and dangerous how loud they are here. Other countries do just fine at more reasonable volumes.
"If the post is correct, there's a theory that instead of the hearing cells dying to cause tinnitus, it's nerve damage along the auditory lines. So it may be possible to heal this before we figure out how to regenerate hearing cells. Though I think they've regenerated cells in some mammals before. Reptiles and birds I think can naturally regenerate from hearing loss."

"Same old, same old....( see my post!)"
"Yes and no. Hearing market is virtually empty, but demand I high for some sort of treatment. Once Dr. Shore device gets to the market and IF results from trials translate to the “field” then you will see how much hype this subject would receive. It is a massive market, with virtually unlimited cash flow. I think once one of the teams reaches decent results in their trials regarding IHC/OHC and Synapses - there is going to be literally battle to try to buy them out/partner by big pharma companies."
"Some people just believe everything they see.. I’ve done enough research now to just understand it’ll take decades and decades for anything. It’s under funded and tbh, nobody cares."
"How does your tinnitus currently affect you in your life? Is it something that you can deal with if the conditions are right or does it affect you in a more negative way? Also, what kind of tinnitus is it and how loud?"

"Don’t worry everybody!  FINRA will protect us!

  
I heard FINRA was going to give out new management awards based on the “inspirations” that are overpaid million dollar executive floor mats.

  
One will be named after their old floor mat CEO. It will be called the ‘Richard Ketchum Arbitration Fraud award’ for excellence in affecting arbitration outcomes to favor FINRA members.

The second will be called the Robber “Piglet” Cook Wall Street Cumguzzler award for sucking street mandated shit through an exhaust pipe and loving it!

The third award will be called the legal employee “future fine collusion and corruption” exchange program to feed their moldy criminal culture and worthless regulatory “practices”."
"I believe clinical trials have started to test higher doses( could be semaglutide), but I have a feeling higher doses will be coming."
I would search r/tirzglutide
"A quick Google search shows there have been studies, both [for diabetes](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/07/13/15/49/SURPASS-1) and [obesity](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(22)01067-8/pdf) where some participants were given 20 mg of tirzepatide. As others mentioned, there are also ongoing studies with 20 mg and 25 mg doses. I personally couldn’t imagine such a high dose but it will be interesting to see where things go in the future. My main concern would be for long term side effects that are currently unknown."
"People shouldn't admit to it if they have haha - it's definitely capped at 15mg for good reason.  However, others have stacked GLP1s or other suppressants.  For example taking a low dose of semaglutide mid week on top of your weekly tirzepatide shot - or using phentermine in pill form on top of your tirz.  Lots of posts around Reddit about stacking."
It’s tirzepatide.  Clinical trial for 20mg and 25mg.
Sub doesn't exist anymore.
I see some of the people refer to “rats” I’m assuming might be code for experimental stuff lol
"Nope. My fault forget a letter 
r/tirzeglutide"
Possibly but that could be referring to people getting peptides that are technically considered for research use only and not for human consumption.  Stacking the meds is something legit providers are offering.  For example some people get the delayed gastric emptying and regulation of blood sugar/insulin from tirzepatide but they don't get good appetite suppression - so their provider gives them phentermine to take with it since it has good suppression effects for alot of people.
Wondered about that myself. They say rats and then say “I have no side effects” lol. What’s next - code word swim? Hah
"Thanks!  Didn't notice the missing letter either, and I was surprised.  But some of these types of subs have been getting shut down lately for sourcing research"
Right!!
"I have to say I was surprised when I looked up TED and saw it was ""rare."" My question is how lol. I feel like most of us that are diagnosed with a thyroid disorder usually have at least a mild form of associated TED.

I was diagnosed with Graves and TED about 15 years ago, and was so upset with the idea of eye decompression surgery.

I deal with physical symptoms but they're still manageable, so I haven't opted for a form of treatment yet because it seems like more cons than pros. (Unless my symptoms become much more severe). 

I really want there to be more available options, though."
"I agree that I don’t think TED is as rare as the medical community thinks—I think the early or mild to moderate symptoms get dismissed or diagnosed as other things, e.g. allergies. I know I was off and on and mildly to moderator affected by both Grave’s and TED for roughly 15 years before both got severe enough. 

For what it’s worth, I received Tepezza treatment and had ear ringing and muffled hearing in one ear during treatment and for about a year afterward. I wasn’t left, thankfully, with any lasting hearing loss."
"I’m also wondering the same, so commenting for more traction. 🙏"
"I had surgery, graves and TED is in remission and I'm living life normally again 🤷🏼‍♀️"
I I have it I was diagnosed in March 2024. I find it odd that post Covid. All of these Tepezza commercials came out. isn’t it funny? Where are there is a new disease? There’s always a brand new treatment kind of seems planned me not trying to be negative. Just trying to speak truth.
"Totally! Truly I don’t think it’s rare, I feel like it skates by as “rare” because of lack of awareness and a lack of treatment options! Orbital decompression story seems so daunting and seems like it should be a last resort for very severe cases. Sorry to hear about your symptoms though, it’s the worst :("
"Definitely. It was so difficult to get diagnosed. I went to top specialists but they tend to see severe cases, so some of them were unsure because my case isn’t that major in terms of bulging. Yet, my vision has definitely been affected, even though scans don’t show pushing on my optic nerves.

Did tepezza help you? Was it worth it? I’m glad it went away but that side effect sounds terrifying. I know there’s a class action lawsuit or something about it now?"
That’s great to hear! I’m just not a candidate for surgery.
"Tepezza helped me a LOT—I wish I had gotten it sooner, but production was shut down in 2020. I still had to have surgery afterward—but I had a severe case with god awful bulging and Tepezza treatment meant that the surgery was easier. 

If you’re interested I can  share a link to a Discord server for those who have received or will receive Tepezza. It might be good for you to read through. Everyone’s experiences with the side effects varied as much as the disease itself.

Edit: here’s the Discord server link—it’s a good group with lots of good info 
https://discord.gg/E5uppuM9"
That sucks. 😞
"Sometimes studies have pauses on recruitments for one reason or another, or actually are no longer recruiting, are getting through referrals slowly but surely, etc. you can give it a few weeks and then follow up!"
You might also try having your primary care doctor contact the investigator for you. that referral helps
"Do you have a regular dr that you see for this condition? If so, their office making the call may hold more weight unfortunately."
"Honestly, we really don't do this at our site. We usually find the potential subjects from among our PI's clinic patients. If they don't get back to you, you could contact the school's IRB (institutional review board) they should be responsive even though this would be a strange request, I bet they could get you the PI's information and you could schedule a clinic visit with them to discuss the trial."
"I’m sorry you’re having this trouble. Staff at these sites are spread extremely thin so if you don’t hear within a couple of weeks, contact them again as it could have just slipped between the cracks. 

I agree with all of the others’ comments and want to recommend that if there is a research consortium on your disease, I would try to establish care as a clinic patient at one of the consortium sites, ideally the lead site if you can, and enroll as a participant in the research consortium. That’s the best way to get on their radar. That way they already know everything they need to know about you before you are even screened for the trial, and they know you’re interested in being contacted. This makes it easy for them and you’ll also be receiving care from a team that is more specialized, well-connected and on the cutting edge of the science on your condition.

If this is one of the first or only drug/therapy trials for the disease, it may be very competitive enrollment unfortunately. Often the people who were involved with the natural history studies that would have proceeded the drug trial end up filling all of the available slots. I wish this weren’t the case but it’s the reality of clinical research at this time. 

Best of luck to you and I hope you are able to get into the study you want."
Did you find it on clinicaltrials.gov? If so there should be a sponsor contact listed there. If it is a smaller company they will reach out to the site as well and follow up with the site on your behalf assuming it is a smaller enrollment study. If they are enrolling thousands unfortunately it may be challenging. I work for a sponsor in oncology so I can say we would be following up to make sure they connected with you but others it may be too many pts to track if it is say an asthma study. Best of luck!
Thank you so much everyone for your responses!!! All of this info and advice is very helpful. Much respect to all of you in the industry.
"My site has an “Ask[sitename]” portal where you can express this interested, and then you can be put in touch with the CRC running the trial. The first step is always getting established as a new patient with an investigator at the hospital, though, so try to see if you can do that even before you’re able to get in touch with the coordinator"
"Have you tried contacting the principal investigator directly? If the staff member you’ve reached out to hasn’t replied yet, I wouldn’t count on them getting back to you. How did you find the clinical trial? Was it through a recruitment ad or a hospital’s research website? If so, you could try searching on clinicaltrials.gov. There may be other sites in your area or region that are also conducting the trial who you may have more luck getting in touch with."
What is your condition if you don't mind me asking? I manage a few sites and have some colleagues in the field I can refer you to :)

"Hello.

> I struggle with some confidence issues. Ie I feel I’m not really smart and perhaps only get to where I am because I work hard and a fraud.

Most people would not even dare dream about attempting a PhD. 
It is a very impressive feat, and going for a post-doc is very impressive as well.


Feeling like a fraud even though you're doing well is pretty common when you're surrounded by smart people and you yourself are smart enough to understand how complicated something is. 
Sometimes we call this impostor-syndrome.


 I would say that doubt is healthy, and it is better than thinking that you're the best around.


All that being said though, do you feel that your issues are bigger at work compared to when you are at home, or with friends or such?

Are you looking for the kind of confidence and/or proof of ""smarts"" that lets you have power over others, or power over some part of yourself?"
"Similar results. I'm also neurodivergent, with a verbal tilt"
"They administered this test in part to help identify your apparent learning disabilities. Your performance being impacted by your problems, whatever they may be, is the point. Your working memory score at an 89 isn't even ""poor"" in relation to your other scores. A personal weakness, perhaps, but within normal limits and not wildly discrepant from even your highest index of 108."
Bryce exceptional 😤
"Thanks for your kind words! Honestly, I really think a PhD is 80-90% project management and writing skills perhaps. Probably any one could do one if they can deal with the project management part. Obviously not speaking for people who do very technical/mathematical etc but mine wasn’t very complicated or ground breaking. And it’s easy to say these things once you have been through it but definately my PhD struggles were related to the organization/writing rather than the applied research part.

Asking this It’s more about giving myself confidence/power never about other people. I am quite goal orientated and perhaps part of my identity that I associated with that is intelligence/competence etc.

Outside of work- I have struggles but manageable and I’m ok with it. Mostly related to depression (good at the moment) /social anxiety + perhaps maintaining friendships. I do have friends but noted some differences when compared to my siblings. Eg all 3 siblings have kept intouch with childhood friends while I have not. I also moved to Canada and would say I have not made any deep friendships although I met my husband and very happily married having met someone here. I know dyspraxia etc has overlaps with ASD and everything overlaps hence I like to say I’m neurodivergent."
Thanks my report does say a discrepancy of this size is found in 7-17% of the population and is in the low average range and there is a statistical significance when compared to other aspects of the evaluation.
Sorry what is Bryce exceptional?
"You are welcome.

You seem like a reflective person.  
That can make it harder to be confident, since you consider not only your own perspective and experiences, but it can also give you an edge when it comes to dealing with other people who are having or have had similar experiences


Having ideas of what kind of confidence you do not want is good. 
Things like that make it easier to find out what kind of confidence one does want. 

Already being aware of that you do not mainly want power over others speaks to a compassionate aspect. 
That in addition to your academical prowess, and moving to live in a different country, could perhaps work well to create an inner image of yourself which can instil or bring forth the kind of confidence you want.

I have a bias towards Psychoanalysis, which often suggests inner work rather than outer work to get to grips with life.
There are usually no ""quick fixes"" of course, and everyone's journey is different.


It is nice to hear that you are happily married.
Is your husband aware of your ideas of confidence? 
Perhaps they also have a few ideas that are much better than what I can come up with, since they know you better."
Really? My WMI is 28 points higher than my PSI and even my score difference is on the lower end for a discrepancy according to a poll done on this subreddit the other week

"Thank you so much for taking the time to give this thoughtful feedback to a stranger on the internet! You are so very appreciated!

Honestly I’ve probably tried 10-15 types of therapists including a psychotherapist and just never got anywhere. But you are probably the first person who I’ve felt actually tried to personalize it rather than just use generic/blanket advice/tools and apply it to me without really focusing or addressing my issues. 

Certainly part of the issue is even if I get positive or constructive feedback or praise. I don’t really accept it (will dismiss and justify why I’m dismissing it), however, if I get negative feedback I take it very personally. I know there is a flaw with this, I’ve  read up on how to correct or manage these issues but the actual application and making change is what is I find difficult (and yes I’ve tried CBT bur also didn’t really work for me). Really the issues are probably deeply ingrained and arise from a difficult childhood and relationship with my mom."
"You are welcome, and thank you.   
I want to help a little if I can, but keep in mind that I am just one person.

Perhaps handling this in a personal way will be the best way to handle it.

If you already suspect that the negation of positive feedback and emphasis of negative feedback in you is due to experiences from the past, it might be helpful to try and revisit these. 
Your hunch about your difficult childhood is probably correct.
It often is when people have had tough childhoods or a bad relationship with someone, but your experiences are your own.

Looking back and looking into details of past events is a pretty common way of handling issues like these in Jungian psychology, but there are also other schools of thought that would lean towards that or encourage it.


Now, going back to your past and looking at these experiences that made you feel certain ways will not be easy all of the time.
Things that made you feel hurt, things that made you feel unfairly treated, and so on.  What is important is to allow you to feel the things these memories bring up, and accept them and yourself as you were.  Remember that they are from your past, and not your present, even if they can affect your present self as it is now.

 One common method is to think of your past self like a child, while viewing yourself as a more or less more powerful adult(even if these things that hurt you didn't necessarily happen exclusively in your childhood).

Consider things like, if this situation happened to someone else, and you knew what they were going through, how would you view them?
If you could tell them something, what would you say?

If you could give them something, what would you give?

Getting the answer to questions like that could take weeks or months to figure out, but sometimes the answer pops into one's mind in mere minutes or even seconds.


Another thing to consider is whether or not you want to let go of your troubled past, or integrate it into your current self.
Possibly you could do a little bit of both, but only you can get a feel for what will be right."
"Love your reviews!!

And please do not spare us the fangirling when you go and see Vadim/Fumi again - some of us have to live vicariously!"
"Actual post coming later, probably tomorrow but as far as Swan Lake's concerned, for now:

AAAAAAH

THEY"
"i’m at swan lake tonight too!!! sobbing my eyes out lol, expected"
"Please, please do a review after tonight's performance of SL! This is my dream cast, and I don't have a prayer of seeing it live. Reading a comprehensive review is the next best thing to being there! Enjoy tonight and throw in a few ""Bravo""s for me! Enjoy yourself mightily, and looking forward to reading all about it!"
Thanks! So looking forward to reading about the performance!❤️
"*it's so blatant the role was choreographed on him* -- I just had a similar experience watching ABT do *Woolf Works*! It's amazing how much the physicality and abilities of the particular dancers shape some roles. 

I am glad you enjoyed yourself here too; could not agree more about Joseph Sissens."
Thank you for taking us along with you!
"Thanks, love your review! I have mixed views on Pantuso but would be interested to see her in this. I wonder if they will end up doing the cinema relay.

I’ve only been to the ROH a few times, but bare feet on seats is a disgrace!"
"So interesting about the bear - I loved this moment when it came to New York with NoBC.  It’s a notoriously tricky stage direction, and I thought Basil Twist solved it brilliantly (and I’m pretty picky about stage craft)."
"Thank you! ❤

Well if the people ask for more fangirling... the people shall receive it lmao!"
So I read on the BalletCo forum: Incredible! I'm going to have to conquer my fear of flying and get across the Pond. If these two are cast for R&J next year I'm there!!
It's incredible they are incredible I don't know how they do it
Will do!! ❤
"I agree. Watson is a really hard act to follow because his whole look, as well as the extreme bendiness, was what inspired so many choreographers.  No one writhed better than him and Winters Tale is all about the writhing.  

The RB seems to see Ball as a dramatic actor but I think he’s a bit too ‘four square’ and conventionally handsome for that. Bracewell is a more interesting ‘type’ and I also think Vadim is becoming a very good actor and developing more presence with age - which must seem very unfair to the others since he already OWNS technique…."
"Her youth really served her well here, she was so lovely and fresh!

I could not BELIEVE what I was seeing!!!!!! It's a damn opera house, not the beach!! People nowadays!"
ooo what are your mixed views on Pantuso?
"I was supposed to be in London this month, but I had to postpone it, so getting to see the Royal's Swan Lake, which was part of the plan, went out the window.  Because of that, your reviews make me smile even more than they would, otherwise.

Thanks. :)"
I'm here too and they're AMAZING!!! Those fouettes!?!
i don’t even know how to begin explaining it lol. i can die happy now. May i dare say this is the best swan lake i’ve ever seen🤌🏻
"Writhe Like Watson in Winter's Tale! Advice for the ages :D

I haven't seen Ball enough to feel like I have a well-informed opinion, but I did see him in a streamed *Romeo and Juliet* (with Naghdi) and thought he was a phenomenal Romeo. Maybe he, too, will develop some range with age!"
"This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I've always felt that Ball is a sort of ""jack of all trades, master of none."" You can cast him in anything, and he'll be fine, possibly even good, but he's never wowed me. 

It's telling that - to me, at least - his career has never really taken off the way the RB probably wanted and expected it to. In less than 2 years as principal, Bracewell has eclipsed Ball and is proving to actually be what they wanted Ball to be."
"I haven’t seen her live, so my opinion is only based on YouTube clips. But, it seems like there’s quite a bit of buzz about her, and I don’t particularly get it. In the last World Ballet Day class, I thought her style wasn’t very clean by RB standards (too much head movement, maybe?) and she was sometimes behind the music, although I thought she had good ballon. She’s still young, though, so plenty time for me to change my opinion!"
"Oh noo that sucks!

Glad to be useful even in this silly small way 😊"
Right??? They're both killing it soo hard
"Don't even try it can't be explained

I feel like I'm flying rn"
"I know what you mean.  He is very ""serviceable"" but not exciting.  I don't ""not book"" for him, but I don't book for him either unless he is dancing with someone else I want to see.  But I imagine an AD is very grateful for someone handsome and tall enough to partner most ballerinas who can reliably do all the steps of principal roles - that's actually pretty rare, even in the RB"
interesting thanks!! i have been rooting for her since the Erik Bruhn Prize but rewatched part of the WBD class and definitely see what you mean about being behind in a few combinations.
same😭😭😭 high off of fumi and vadim
GIRL THIS THIRD ACT!!!!
Wow wow wow. Am on the bus home and still haven’t picked up my jaw.  Fumi served!!!!!
No words for real I'm shook
Oh and the kiss on the lips at the curtain calls??? I may have squealed out loud
YES OH MY GOD!!! Confirmation!!!!
Yes this was so cute!
Well thanks for this.
"Do you know if they will tell me what my Lp(a) measurement is? I just got this done a month ago at my GP, but still love collecting any sort of data like that."
"Considering that I’m a relatively healthy guy with astronomically high cholesterol, I’m going to have to check this out! Thanks!"
"“You consent to the sharing of personal data, even sensitive personal data”

lol I closed up the application after that. How personal and sensitive are we talking here?"
They will. You schedule a call in a few weeks and they tell you all of your results. You getting them by email as well.
"Reading into it, this particular kind is resistant to medication and being genetic, your diet and general health has nothing to do with it. I hope you get some answers!"
"This is pretty standard language for clinical trials. It's not nefarious. 

Researchers collect a bunch of identifiers (name, address, date of birth, etc.) that is considered PHI (personal health information) which is protected by HIPAA. They also can collect medical history which can be considered 'sensitive'. In this study, it seems like they at a minimum obtain genetic information about you related to cholesterol.

Research like this is incredibly regulated. The researchers are required by law to have paperwork with boiler-plate language where you sign and give them permission to collect this data from you, store it, analyze it, and share it (generally amongst the research team but sometimes between teams)."
"I assume they mean your cholesterol results, but it does also give me pause from signing up."
"I know I’ve got high cholesterol that runs in my family. Most of my mom’s side is on some kind of medication to manage it. There’s definitely a genetic component as I have an okay (not great I admit, but not bad) diet and get regular exercise. If it’s resistant to medication then that may not be what I’ve got going on, since that has helped me. I’ll still check it out for sure though!"
From what I understand the purpose is trying to find out the percentage of the population with this variant. They will most likely map everyone that tested positive for it. Name and address was really the only thing I needed to input.
"Nice news, thanks for sharing. I have high hopes for crispr!!!"
"Jazz bought Celator for $1.5 bn in 2016. However, even after approval of VYXEOS for AML, the insurers refused to cover/reimburse Jazz for non-HCT AML patients. If you look and compare the overall survival data including around 1/3 of HCT(HSCT) patients vs. the HCT patients group, you can pretty much deduce that the benefit is not that great for non-HCT patients (also, it is very dismal for the control group in the non-HCT arm). A Fiercebiotech article of 2018 mentions an analyst downgrading VYXEOS sales forecast for 2023 to around low $400 M because of slow uptake. In 2023, Jazz sales from VYXEOS was only around $150 M, much lower than already lowered expectation following the initial launch and slow uptake. If you can see here, HCT/HSCT/Allo-SCT patients often comprise a minority of patient groups in above AML trials. For AML patients that relapse or worsen, it seems to be that the majority is ineligible for HCT (I mean, otherwise, they would gotten that treatment earlier on). And for those patients, the outcome has been generally poor, so huge unmet need for the patients included in the currently on-going SLS Regal trial.

"Your BP is completely fine for both standing and lying positions, I'm not sure why you would be prescribed midodrine to increase your numbers.

He would still hear you till the last hour. Most importantly let him know you all will surely see him again and when you do, it will be like no time has passed. I feel your sorrows in my bones. May lights guide him home. Shalom "

That 21-17 at the bottom is crazy. Hard to understand why it was aproved
"I've thoroughly looked at the dataset in the ""92%"" claim and it is thoroughly misleading. 

For one, the analysis provided *does not even compare percent vaccinated to unvaccinated.* If 100% of the population is vaccinated, 100% of deaths will also be vaccinated. For instance, if I have a chart that says 5000 died in Group A and 100,000 died in Group B, but do not mention that Group A has 2500 people and Group B has 1,000,000 people, it is fairly useless for comparative analysis. 

Second: while the data-set does not includes enough information on the *current percent* of the population vaccinated it does include a metric called the ""age-standardized mortality rate"" to compare two populations. Keep in mind: the ""age-standardized mortality rate"" is not a ""crude rate"". Instead it's a way to compare health outcomes for each age group. [Here is a sample data-point for an age-standardized mortality rate](https://i.imgur.com/vBINvXz.png). While I did not look at all months in that window, there seemed to be a massive disparity in the unvaccinated. But again, this is not crude mortality rate - but instead one adjusted for expected outcomes in age groups. The articles I could find that have previously sourced that chart *completely* ignores this metric."
U aren't wrong. But keep in mind this was at the time when the media was saying the hospitals were being over run by the unvaxxed
CA19-9 is just one protein marker. It may or may not indicate cancer recurrence or spread as other issues can elevate it. You say the scans are clear. Your doctor will take the test into account and should have more info on that test in your dad's situation.
"Wow. If it works, this is huge. fMRI methods also show some promise."
"I'm following this closely. I have all the symptoms of early stage CTE and the risk factors. But there's other treatable issues it could be (I also have the risk factors for not being able to absorb iron, and my life is miserable enough to want to die anyway). So ruling this out would mean whatever I have can be treated.

Also, it looks like with CTE it's an autoimmune reaction to correctly folded tau. But with Alzheimer's it's a prion form of tau, which misfolds other tau into neurotoxins, the only way to stop it is to remove the toxin, which is nearly impossible when the toxin can create more of itself. So I'm wondering if some sort of immunosuppressant can prevent damage from CTE. Like the ones they give to organ transplant recipients."
"Wow , proud of my country!"
I would be interested in knowing. My husband is 10 years in the NFL and has all the symbols.
Indeed. This is honestly the best news I’ve read in a while. I can’t find anything on joining the study so if anyone has info please share. Project Enlist https://projectenlist.org and CLF Canada https://www.concussionfoundation.ca both work closely with CAMH and may be the ones to reach out to.
"I would look to places with large somali populations.   I am in Minnesota and there are several somali mental health providers here.   Good first step would just be to google ""somali mental health minneapolis"" and randomly reach out to someone you find there.  They might be able to point you in the right direction."
"I can put some feelers out for you… Washington is a Psypact state (meaning you may not be limited to just WA licensed psychologists) so that should help somewhat. Physicians have a similar interstate Compact system for reciprocity which WA is also part of, though I’m not familiar with specifics. Though, maybe your available options depends on how contentious of a case, i.e., what’s your budget, are you willing to accept a virtual evaluation or are you willing to pay someone to travel? 

Also, is an interpreter needed? It may just add some complicating factors if any testing was indicated. Feel free to message me on that if you want!"
You may also want to consider reaching out to anthropologists who have studied religious and cultural beliefs and practices of Somali communities.
"I wonder if UW’s Global Health faculty would have any ideas. This professor is the director of the Somali Health Board.

You may need a cultural expert as well.
Pittsburgh also has a large Somali population
Thanks—I’ve sent out a few leads on that front!
Thanks for the input. It’s a Murder 1 case so I’m pretty confident we can justify the expert funding request and we do not need an interpreter. I’ll dm you.
Virtual eval or in person preferred?
I’d prefer in person but if they are out of state we can definitely do the eval over zoom.
"Hopefully some of this can shed light on a bunch of other problems, such as ME/CFS."
Finally….
"I work in radiation oncology and ditto. The notes are absolutely nuts and very much all over the place bc by the time they get to us, they’ve seen 3+ specialists for different reasons related to the issue and there needs to be a sum up of all that. I always need more than the given 2 hrs to prechart but am afraid to ask, afraid that I’ll be seen as inadequate."
"Oooofffff. Have you tried going over your direct manager straight to your Senior Account Manager? Normally, SAMs will just find a reason to fire scribes like that and get a vet scribe from a different clinic to cover once you leave until someone can be trained."
"Off topic, but how did you land a job as clinical trial coordinator. I am myself a scribe amabassador and looking for CRC jobs but to no avail. Dont even get interview calls. Any tips?"
"I worked with Hem/Onc. Similar experience in terms of having to copy prior notes. They keep it all like its a diary. You don't have to fire the new person, but let the management know this person's progress and your recommendations. Ultimately, it is their responsibility to make the final say, so if they decide to keep pushing with her and the provider doesn't like it, it really isn't your fault. They could also move her to another specialty/doctor who she might fit with better. You are a truly great soul for wanting what is best for your provider, but outside of training and updating the managers, you might not have much control over the situation, WHICH IS OK. 

If you want training tips, I might suggest:

1. Staying after/arriving a bit earlier to go over charts.

2. Make sure she is writing down notes in regard to new information that she can review.

3. Give her some homework assignments - have her search up certain terminology that she misses frequently.

4. See if you can schedule some one on one time with her so she can learn some things outside the pressure of clinic - think of it like an extended pre-clinical bridge training."
Tell the doctor that you have no control over this and to contact someone from SA.
"I would ask your doctor to send her complaint to you and refusal to accept her new scribe in writing (email). Then cc your boss and her supervisor. Forward it and you can say, 

""Dr. XXX is unsatisfied with the quality of work received by ____ and is refusing them as a primary scribe."" 

Then go into all the stuff you've done to try to help. 
""In working to improve, we have had 6 training sessions and covered these topics- 
-bullet out the things you tried
-for example, screenshared my workflow process for completing note & pasting 
-difficulties with second language and medical terminology/grammatical errors
-reviewed note sections yet continues to place imaging results at the top of note with incorrect section yadayada""

At my company the doctors refusal of an individual team member is prioritized as urgent. Sounds like they need to give her more training resources than any one individual can handle in one off coaching sessions.  (they hired her) Maybe she'd be a better fit at a less intense specialty than onco placement. If you like her, perhaps suggest some of her strengths would frame this in a better light for her- ""excellent at capturing HPI info, would be a good fit for Family med"" for example.."
"I'm bitter and angry with our management right now so take what I say with a grain of salt. Just just take more than two hours. SA can afford it with how much money they're fucking out of us. You have more power than you think. Think about what a dumpster fire the hiring process was. Management hates going through that. Also, your letter of recommendation doesn't come from SA, it comes from your doctor. If management questions you, hide behind your doctor's legs like a shy child and ask them to defend you (Assuming you have a good relationship). The two docs I work with would absolutely defend me if I asked them for help."

How did you get into med school with a 2.8 ?
"UNL is a Big 10 school which would break the tie in my book. (Remember, the N on their football helmets stands for Knowledge)"
Do you think it would make a colossal difference in my case where I get it from? SD is significantly cheaper and only 39 creds compared to 48 at UNL.
"Phase 1 research takes absolutely forever to conduct, analyze, and publish. I wouldn’t waste my limited summer messing with it. And ultimately, it’s boring and it isn’t serving you for where you want to go. 

- source: I worked full time in clinical research before med school."
"medical students hoping to be rewarded for their work (ie publication) during the length of their time in medical school have no business being involved with clinical trials...

even tho RCTs are like the gold standard for guiding treatment, and most people don't give a shit about the retrospective shit studies that med students pump out, unfortunately this is how the game is played..."
Clinical trials like these are not good projects for med students
"As someone who spent most of med school running a phase 1 RCT with barely a pub to show for it by application time, I recommend avoiding RCTs unless it's where your passion lies. If that is for sure what you want to spend your time on, finding something in PM&R would probably be better. PM&R is a good specialty for med student research because many of their outcomes (QoL scales, mobility tests, etc.) and interventions (PT exercises, stretches, aerobic exercise, etc.) don't require money."
ask if they have extra data laying around and do a secondary analysis or literature review. Takes less time. I agree RCT takes a few years to finish and  publish. I worked in research before medical school and published.
Not sure I agree with all these comments. Y’all know op doesn’t have to exclusively do this as his only project right
Thanks for the input. I think I’ll turn it down.
Agreed. Thanks!
"Thanks for the input, I’ll politely decline his offer"
"Hopefully this answers the questions the luddites over at /r/technology has about why this is better than non-invasive BCIs and other cursor control technologies.

For those who did not read the article - his speed and accuracy of control is nearly 2x higher than previous world records for assistive technology, and he is able to use the neural link lying down, whereas other assistive technology, like his mouth stylus, he had to use sitting up, which places him at risk of pressure sores, and which meant he needed people to adjust his position regularly to prevent this."

"It’s been 100 days… knowing personally how long Civ games can go, has he finished that round of Civ VI he started, or is he doing “one more turn”?"
Wow. Any future plans?
The major tech and futuristic subs are weirdly full of tech illiterate and small minded people
"I agree but to be fair, there are other technologies that don't involve movement but involve actual brain scanning without it being invasive. There are helmets for example that scan your brain waves. I fully support Neuralink's mission but whether having a chip in your brain is significantly better than wearing a helmet scanning your brain waves still remains to be seen."
How long until someone hacks into your chip and controls your body movements.
Civ games have an end?
Hmm?
"The bigger a sub gets, the higher the share of mainstream users who only have surface level information."
"When all companies working on headsets have switched to meditation and sentiment analysis, there is not much to support the tech. There have been many promises in the past few years but no one have achieved functional prototypes allowing real use. 

Maybe with some future tech, but at this point it's more fiction that real possibilities."
"Helmets struggle to get past the skull, notorious for getting in between the brain and other things"
"I doubt they would be as fast, and the sealed nature of the neuralink means he's not going to get pressure sores on his head for example from a band. 

He notes that before he needed people to give him his stylus, and I assume someone would have to set him up with a helmet also.

Neuralink gave him a huge amount of independence, such that he used it for 60+ hrs per week on one occasion."
Even if slower I would prefer a helmet rather than a wire being stuck through my brain and the accompanying scar tissue being formed.
Just make it NFC or really well encrypted Bluetooth. It doesn't need to be accessible except at maintenance intervals.
Found the guy that doesn't understand how brains or this technology works.
"It does only read, not write signals to the brain."
I've certainly noticed more luddism on this sub recently.
"Don't quote me on this but I did see an article/paper a few months back regarding using transformers to do brainwave to text. Think it was just an initial POC which had 80%+ accuracy in a very short amount of training time. 

If that's refined to say 95%+ that's a device I'd have no problem dropping 3-5k on as it's far more useful than say Apple VR."

"The point isn’t that you’re sacrificing too much but that he isn’t willing to save himself. As you said, you also suffer from mental health issues but you got yourself to therapy, take meds etc.

You can’t make someone do something they don’t want to do. It sounds like in the last 2 years since the near-death event, he hasn’t made any efforts to get himself out of his hole. It’s at the point where you may no longer be supporting him but instead are enabling him.

I say this as someone who had a similar relationship."
"Love isn't supposed to weigh you down and you'll feel the same from your partner. Also, you may love someone but that doesn't mean the relationship is healthy. You are essentially his caretaker, the sole provider of emotional support, a Fixer. He's supposed to want to be better for you and he doesn't. The only way that he'll get better is if he doesn't have someone doing everything for him which is you. "
"The last post you made does not sound like you are happy at all in this situation.

This post sounds like you convincing yourself that your love is special enough to justify this life you’re living with a man who won’t help himself.

It’s your choice and your life but you have to be truly honest with yourself about the situation you’re in.

Also as hard as it is for you to watch this man not help himself improve his situation. That’s as hard as it is for people who love you to watch you do the same."
"It sounds like you’re putting in a lot of effort to make his life better which is admirable. Question, is he putting the same amount of effort into making his own life better? Do you see him struggling and trying despite his condition? Is he seeking professional help and putting in the work to heal and recover? If the answer is no then he probably won’t ever. 

Do you want to be his caretaker for the rest of your lives? It’s ok if the answer is yes, I’d just want you to really think about it."
"You say that this is a phase, but he's never going to improve if he doesn't get therapy and/or medication.


His depression won't magically vanish after you've told him to brush his teeth the 5,000th time or because you made his favorite meal. 


You're essentially enabling him. He has no need to change because you've become his mom, cook, maid, personal assistant, and more. Why would he give up all of that to be a fully functional adult and do his own laundry or get a job?


As someone who has battled Depression and other disorders my whole life, I am speaking from experience. 


You can love someone and still need to leave them. Love isn't enough. Your love won't cure him. It can't replace grieving properly and getting treatment for his trauma. 


The best way to show him that you love him is to make him go to therapy. If he won't, he might if you break up with him because he will see that there are consequences to his actions. 


Are you going to let this trauma-laced person father a child off of you? What kind of life would a child have with a dad who ignored them? Who never took care of them and was never alone with them. They would feel unloved and unlovable. Nothing you say could make them change their mind because the evidence is in front of them everyday. That's a very cruel thing to do. 


Please think about why you would rather be his mom and maid than support his need for professional help. "
"I find your belief that other people ""don't really love their partners"" really telling.

It seems like rather than being in an equal partnership, you are in a performance. You are proving that your love for him is real and deep, but not holding him responsible for or expecting him to love you the same way.

It seems like you are a really strong and sincerely loving person who doesn't believe in giving up on someone you love.

But this is not real love. He is not reciprocating, that is why people are telling you to leave. One-way unconditional love is not as meaningful as you think it is. 

You deserve better, maybe consider getting into therapy to work on your self esteem. You have a lot of love and deserve someone who gives it back."
"Why don't you love yourself as much as you love him? Speaking as someone who suffers from severe depression and anxiety if I had an SO who helped me the way you do him? I'd never even try to get better - the only reason I'm even trying to get better now is because my mother needs my help. 

Last year when she was healthy (or at least healthier than she is now) I pretty much gave up and almost checked out. She did everything for me - which ironically made me feel like a loser and that she deserved better than me. I'm still depressed and I'm not doing more than making it through the day but that's still better than last year. 

You think your helping him - and you are. You're helping him stay this way - he has no incentive to get better. 

I wish you luck."
"It kind of seems like you enjoy him being totally depends on you. Like if he relies on you completely then he will never leave. By chance, do you have anxious attachments?"
">I don’t believe that there is too much sacrifice for love.

Holy hell that's a toxic approach to life.

It's also weird that you're holding yourself to this standard while completely OK with your boyfriend not sacrificing a single thing for you. But ok."
"“The issue here isn’t that he’s depressed, it’s that he’s unwilling to do any work to try to help himself”.

 Op this is your words, why don’t you believe them? The issue has clearly been identified by you. A person cannot successfully help another person who doesn’t willingly work to help themselves .  Keywords are “successfully” and “willingly”. 

  Being a  HEALTHY supportive partner is doing the  things described above, but to a person who is actively working to heal, seeking professional help, is attempting to live, etc. OP the only thing you’re not doing for your partner right now is breathing for them.  Leaving your partner would not be abandoning them in their time of need, unfortunately this great deed that is being done on your part is crippling him.

  Currently your partner doesn’t need to “get  better” or have a desire to “get better” because he has everything he needs/wants done for him by you."
"Hadn’t ever understood the whole “miss the forest for the trees” analogy but your post just made it clear. 

It’s nice to love someone so much that you’re willing to do everything for them. The thing is that when they’re gone, what will you have left after dumping everything into a man that (sorry for being insensitive here) but realistically may not have a lot of years left and is not even married to you? 

Nothing. Absolutely nothing."
"No you are wrong to think that way about everyone. It is something that every people that care for you is telling you, if many people that have no stake in this scenario, and have different life experiences, telling you that you need to walk away, means you are in the wrong.

You have a saviour complex. You are ruining your future and when you wake up from your fantasy, it would be too late.

Love yourself more."
"There's helping and there's enabling. You're not helping.

You're destroying yourself and you're not helping.

You're not helping yourself, you're also not helping him. You're doing the both of you a huge huge huge disservice.

Altruism and selfishness look sometimes very much alike. You're not doing this for him.

And you know what, I don't even know if you're actually sacrificing anything here without gaining something else entirely. You're so proud of the lengths you go to ""help"" this guy who won't ever find or be able to find a way or a will to help himself because that will get smothered before it can even see the light, it makes me think that you can't actually be by yourself without having somebody to take care of. Would you even know what to do with yourself if you weren't serving a gown man or a child, a pet, a sick, elderly relative or anybody else?

You're enabling his sickness and you're very proud of it. You find your own value in it. 

 Do as you please, but it's not good.



ETA typos and such"
"Mental illness is a reason, not an excuse. It’s very sweet that you’re willing to do all of this for him, but he needs to put in the work to better himself also. You’re basically a live in caretaker for him more than you are a partner"
You might try reading codependent no more
"You know there's a middle ground between unconditionally sacrificing everything for him and walking away, right? It sounds like you have gotten to a point where you are enabling him rather than helping.


I really think you need to push him to see a doctor to get medication and get into therapy. Group therapy for grief and/or individual therapy. This isn't sustainable and it will get worse.


It sounds like you are a very empathetic, strong and devoted person who is working hard for him and yourself."
"I don't see any ""we"" in your post. I see YOU carrying the entire load. This is not sustainable for you. 

My guess is you're projecting your feelings and how you'd want to be treated on to him. Noble & all that, but he isn't you; he isn't doing anything to improve his problems and you're actually enabling him to be completely static & stuck where he is. So I can see why his family is telling you to leave him. They want him to get better, but he won't/can't because you're making it too comfortable for him to wallow in his own misery. You're the biggest impediment to him actually getting better."
"> I don’t believe that there is too much sacrifice for love. 

Too bad your boyfriend doesn’t feel the same way."
"You are legit drowning yourself to keep him afloat and are in denial because you say you love him so much and these are the sacrifices we make for our loved ones. 

But there’s going to come a day where you can’t care for yourself or you are going through some shit. Do you actually think he will snap out of it, step up to help you? I’m not saying this shit to be cruel. But you seriously have some blinders on right now."
You should read up on codependency. Wishing you peace
"I’m gonna guess this is OPs “first serious relationship” because she thinks everyone else’s “just doesn’t love their partners enough” that’s why they hate her super special loving relationship. 

The hard reality is that you can’t fix someone by “loving them enough” if he’s refusing to get any sort of help there’s nothing anyone (OP included) can do. All she’s going to do is waste years of her life by draining her soul to fill his cup. 

They want OP to break up with him because 

1 she is being used weather she lets herself see it or not 

2 sometimes people(the boyfriend) need to hit rock bottom in order to change their ways & actually want to help themselves. 

MY ADVICE: don’t get married or have his children until he is dedicated to going to therapy for the long haul & is full on & continuing to take his medication(s)"
Congrats on adopting a 300 month old is he fully potty trained yet?
"Sweetie, you are enabling his behavior. I’m not telling you to care less, I’m actually telling you to care more about this situation. He needs to have the moment where he decides that he wants to get better. 

I was in a similar position as you. My SO took a hard hit on his mental health, and I accidentally (by my ignorance) provided everything so that he can stay in his position. 

I had to let go, and then he started moving. But it was his decision, not mine. 

You have to let go. I’m not saying to break up with him, but stop doing chores for him. Get out of this co-dependency start the steps towards a healthier relationship. When he starts to do things for himself, it’s when he will feel empowered again to overcome his difficulties. Action is the best course towards progress. Stagnancy is regression. Please, keep that in mind. 

Please have professional help (for him and for you) and I wish you the best on the healing journey that’s to start. 

It is a decision and an action. It must come from him. 

Take care."
"If you want to stick with him, stick with him. But don’t fool yourself that you’re helping him. In fact, I’d say you’re harming him further; he’s never going to help himself if you’re doing everything for him."
"I don't know. Will you keep living for him for the rest of your or his life, whichever comes first?
I don't know... I feel so uneasy with the way you seem to relish your role of martyr. Sounds so extremely melodramatic. And totally unhelpful to any of you. But hey, if you enjoy playing the martyr superhero, knock yourself out. 

And b4 you ask, yes, I've been in deep depression myself, after experiencing traumatic events."
"To steal from another redditor ""**Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.**""

Yes he's depressed but so are you. You're doing things for him but he's not doing anything for you. 

Just because someone is in a bad situation doesn't mean that they're not being selfish and taking advantage of others. 

He's taking advantage of you! 

Love yourself first. You deserve better!

This isn’t healthy love. Sounds like obsession and your OCD is driving it.
The problem isn’t that he’s depressed the problem is that you’re enabling his lows and he isn’t forced to get out of it.
You need to walk away from him
"You cannot pour from an empty cup. There’s only so much you can do for other people. You can’t force people to swim, and you should never let someone who’s drowning take you under with them."
"You are an amazing person to do this for someone you love.  I think the concern is coming in because you are sacrificing A LOT while it doesn't sound like he's actively working on improving.  You don't want to find yourself still doing everything for him 10 years from now.  So it's not that they don't support you helping him, it's that it won't do either of you any good to help him now if he's not willing to at least try.  You highlighted, ""we will get through this."" Does he agree this is a ""we"" effort and is he seeking help beyond your care?  

I don't think you're wrong for standing by someone you love, and your own diagnosis gives you more insight. It should also help you set a boundary so your own mental health doesn't degrade to a level like his. There's nothing wrong with caring for someone, but you need to care for yourself too. Just like you care about him, others care about you and don't want to see you spiral or burn out, especially if he's not improving."
"Everyone just has to wait for you to go through the motions. ne day you will realize they are right, and the man you expect to appear (because you see glimpses of him) will never surface and stay outside. Nothing we can say to change your mind."
"You seem very invested in making sure everyone sees how much you're sacrificing for love. Maybe exmine that. Why is it so important for you to save this person at the expense of your own mental health?

FYI, that's not what true love is."
"Seems like everyone is right. Your boyfriend is his own anchor around his neck, it won't be long before he drags you down as well."
"I believe you when you tell us you're committed to him. And I know you've been with him a while and he's been there for you when you needed it. I believe that you love him dearly. 

I'm not telling you to leave him. But I do want you to please consider one thing: 

You can't save people. All you can do is support them while they save themselves. 

He did the latter for you and that's why you're devoted to him. 

Are you doing the same for him?  Or are you enabling and/or being codependent?"
"As someone who was in a bad place while my ex sacrificed a lot of his time and mental energy... They're right. You should leave for your own sake. If he has a support system with his family it may be better to rely on that. You can also have an honest conversation about how taking care of him has been affecting you and that perhaps it's time to refer to. Professional for help.

He'll never stop taking your energy until he gets a big wake up call and good kick in the a-ss. I'm saying this as the partner who drained my ex mentally"
You're his mom now and you're enabling things. Trust the people who love you and know you best. You're way too young to be living this caretaker lifestyle. In a couple more years you'll be completely burned out and he may no longer be attracted to you because he sees you as his parent instead of thanking you for your sacrifice. Give him a kick in the ass to jumpstart his healing or move on for both your own and his sanity.
"You need to have a coming to god meeting with him. 

You can’t love him to health. For y’all to survive you need to see him putting in the effort, implementing change and genuinely wanting to get better. 

You can’t help someone who doesn’t want it."
"Look homie, there are reasonable limitations to everything. There is a point where you constantly caring for him may be doing more harm than good. If he's in there, he's going to need to put in the effort to pick himself up.



Why don't you take a break from the relationship? Get out of it and remind yourself what life is like when you aren't a caretaker. Force him to have to pick himself back up and do something for himself. It doesn't necessarily mean the permanent end of your relationship. 



Contrary to popular culture, love is not all you need. Relationships (and this is even more true of marriages) are hard work, but there needs to be a balance. You're supposed to be a team. If a partner isn't carrying their weight, it's okay to shoulder the burden for a while, but there needs to be a road map in place for how it's going to return to a healthy balance. What you're doing is unsustainable. You will burn out. I know that seeing the end of a relationship is scary and it's going to hurt like hell, but he's in no condition to be a good partner and if you keep this up, you won't be either."
is he doing anything to help himself?
"Saying “others don’t really love their partners” is rather presumptuous. Maybe others know to prioritize themselves and love themselves enough to do so.

You are prioritizing him to the point of enablement. That’s not going to help either of you, ultimately."
"As a person with MDD and GAD, and as someone with family and friends who also struggle with them too, I get where you’re coming from, but also where your friends and family are coming from too; and my advice is that your support isn’t enough for your partner to come through this episode- not that you should (or could) be doing more, but that there’s an element of wisdom from those saying to walk away- if you interpret what they are saying is that you need to stop enabling the inertia, which by meeting all his physical needs and reminding him to maintain personal hygiene etc, you are inadvertently doing. 

Instead, before you ‘do’ for him, invite him to do the thing with you and introduce a natural consequence if he doesn’t engage- eg, if he doesn’t want to cook with you, just serve your own plate. Don’t serve his…the next time, just prepare your own meal. He needs to feel like he has some capacity as an adult and while he doesn’t have the energy to initiate at this point, he will feel a sense of achievement if he’s part of the process.

I have a nursing background- and central to the philosophy of modern nursing is that a patient should be cared for by doing as little as possible for the patient so they can maintain their own agency- a simple example of this- immediately after surgery a patient probably can’t stand on their own but that doesn’t mean that they can’t shower themselves, so all they need is help getting situated safely in the shower and you leave them to it until you do the hard to reach bit…over time, the patient regains their independence and goes home but if they are treated like they can’t do anything they will believe it and they take much longer to recover.

It’s often really hard and confusing for carers to step back and not feel like you’re abandoning your person but I encourage you to reflect and discern where your support is delaying or obstructing his progress and transition gradually to where you are metaphorically standing by ready to catch them if they fall but allowing them to do as much as they can (which is generally a lot more than they think).

Please really take this on board, because I guarantee that while you feel capable of carrying him, it will eventually be too much and you’ll crash- and if he’s still in his hole, you won’t have the support you need then."
"I've been on both sides of this. 

There's a point where, if you're depressed and someone is doing the necessary things, you don't bother trying, because why would you? 

I really hate to say it - you're enabling him to avoid doing what he needs to do to get better. 

I'm NOT saying break up with him - I'm saying stop enabling him. It isn't on you to carry him out of the well of depression - it's on you to shine a light so he can see where to climb. But you CAN'T shine the light, because you're trying to carry him, which is taking EVERYTHING because you're already engaged in YOUR climb. 

Stop doing the basics - don't tell him to bathe (at least, for a long as you can stand it. If he's doing nothing, that can be weeks) don't make him food (or, not more often than once a day) and dear gods stop making it all from scratch! Don't pick up after him. Don't buy him things he hasn't asked for, even if he needs it (except prescriptions) 

Hopefully this will be a big enough shock. But right now, he's barely hanging on, and doesn't want to DO - but what he needs *is to start living*. Picking up his own mess is a reminder of LIFE. I know it sounds weird, but, it's a reminder he CAN, he SHOULD - he's alive enough to make a mess, ergo *he's alive*. And NEEDS TO START LIVING AGAIN. 

But *you can't save him*. ONLY HE CAN SAVE HIMSELF

It's hard. It hurts. For both of you. Standing and watching my partner while he was like this was one of the hardest things I've ever done - but after 6 months, it was all I could do to try and get him *back*. It took time, there were setbacks, and I had to be reminded more than once to not judge his progress by my own (if nothing else, different hormones and life experience between AFAB and AMAB people. And different trauma.)

I really hope this helps, and I send GoodThoughts(tm) to you both

Ps: the carer also needs care. I'm a random internet stranger, but then again I've no bias, if you need to talk, and i HAVE been you, the you needing the therapy for C-PTSD, the you now trying to save your partner from his own pain. If you need that neutral ear, message me. Might take a few days for me to respond, but I will"
"At this point, you are enabling him, not helping him. He sees no point in taking initiative and getting better while you are carrying his whole load. He needs to get help, and he needs to get back on his feet - and he won't do that while you are spoon feeding him and wiping his arse for him!"
"I don't think you know what the word love means.  You need to love yourself to be capable of loving someone else. 

I'd be all for sticking with him and helping if he was even trying but he isn't.  You can't help someone who doesn't want to fix the problem.  Sticking around is just enabling and hurting him more in the long run."
"I don't think you should break up with him. 

However, I do think you need to have an honest conversation with him and tell him that it's time for him to get help beyond you. At the very least therapy. Don't be afraid to be blunt with him, and if he refuses, make him go anyway. If you are giving him all of this endless support for love, then you can be tough on him for love too. He sounds like he may need an extra push given that it's been so long."
"I’m afraid you are his last safety net before he needs to get back in the drivers seat of his own life and I worry that nothing you can say will change him. As I see it you have three options:
1) Stop doing everything you do and let him descend in to the squalor of missing your effort and having to put it in himself. Warn him first you will be doing this specifically because he is making no effort to help himself and you do more than you can carry alone.
2) Break up with him; show him you won’t stand for being the rock indefinitely, it’s not the life you signed up for. Try to move on, maybe consider dating again if he sorts his shit out.
3) Just try and be as honest and direct as you can about what you need and how badly he needs to change and start making effort for himself again. Knowing that if he doesn’t you’re going to have to keep being harder and harder on him until one of you gives. Which could result in you doing all the work for the foreseeable future.

Good luck OP. Don’t let you desire to support him drag you down too."
"If ""love is blind"" was a person it would have been OP. Even though I shamelessly went to my Toxic ex 4 times I wasn't this much hopeless.. Honey, you're wasting your time.. can you really imagine yourself living with him for the rest of your life !? Even though you can.. you posted it here so imma still give my two cent opinion. Loving someone shouldn't be this hard you know!! You're just enabling him.  But still your life.. I mean on the bright side you're saving a lot of girls from him So I guess you're doing great. Nahh keep him. All the best."
"I am with you OP!
There are people who can barely stay loyal in a marriage, and here you both are literally loving and supporting each other, in sickness and in health.
There's only one thing that I can say to help you. 
THIS SHALL TOO PASS 💜
On the other hand, I do understand that you're not here for advice or to understand whether you should continue the relationship.
You're here because of the burn out, you're here to know how to cope yet help your boyfriend, and you're here to know if there's something else/more you can do to help him.
For that I would say get help from family for your household stuff and pets. While yours and your boyfriend's health and hygiene can become your priority.
And for his health, maybe you can try homeopathy/ayurvedic treatment. Or reiki and meditation (I am not a strong believer of it but I have seen it work for people. You can PM me and I can get a reiki group to help you for FREE, I would need his name and picture)
And last, you both seem like lovely people and great partners to each other. I can only imagine the effort you're putting in, to come out of this. Hats off to you and your live for him 💕 
Sending my prayers and love."
"understandable. u are a good example of for sickness and health. but i also understand the other side. if ur willing. continue on what ur doing. beware it might take a toll. and even resentment. maybe he will get better. hope that he does. in the end, we are just rolling the dice. NAH"
"Your life decisions are completely yours to make. These people that tell you what to do, they don't have to live with the aftermath and the consequences of their recommendations. The choice is yours ultimately. It sounds like you love the guy and that he is worth the efforts to you."
"You are incredibly strong and brave person to stand by him during this time. Hrs lucky to have you. 

But he kept let you keep doing this forever. Yea, trauma and grief and depression can become all-consuming and debilitating. But he needs to work through this and move on. Yea it's not easy and it takes time. But please don't let yourself become trapped by this. 

I'm living with debilitating depression myself. Currently single. One of my biggest fears is becoming a burden to the people around me. 

You're right to stand by him and help take care of him but he can take care of himself. But you also need to encourage him to learn how to take care of himself again."
"You can't save him, you can't fix him. In fact, in trying to do either of those things you're going to end up hurting yourself. 

His situation is sad, but he's an adult and needs to either step up and find the will to just start, or fail and live in misery. 

You are waaaay too young to be a care taker for an able adult. Everyone is right. You need to leave him and take care of yourself. If he manages to pull himself together someday and you're still single and willing to try again (if he comes back) then you can reconsider. But now it's time to let him sink or swim and you go live your life without him weighing you down."
"you say it yourself: he is unwilling to work on helping yourself. 

  
you're going to run yourself to the ground for this guy, and never, ever have support from him. 

  
if this is the life you want, go for it."
"The problem I see, and that you mentioned, is that he's unwilling to help himself. It sounds to me that maybe he's gotten or is getting used to you doing everything. If you're just going to do everything for him, what incentive would he have to get better? However, at the end of the day, it's up to YOU how you want to handle things going forward. Do you want this to be your relationship dynamic for the rest of your lives? Do you think that at some point one day, you're going to burn out from doing everything and resent him? If you want that/are willing to deal with that, then that's fine. I know for myself, if my partner was not putting in any effort to get better, I would walk away. Relationships are PARTNERships, two people working together to make things work, not one person giving 90-100% and the other doing nothing or next to nothing. I'm not saying you shouldn't support your partner when they can't put in their fair share of the work. People have ups and downs and there are always going to be times when one partner has to pick up the slack for the other. I just worry for you that he'll get used to this and take advantage of you."
"At this point you are enabling him, not helping him.   You should be discussing the difference in your therapy and getting help to distinguish between the two.

He needs to be evaluated, and getting appropriate treatment maybe even in-patient.  Neither of you deserve to live like this, but he has to make an effort."
Sounds like your boyfriend needs to work on himself. Some people can’t be ‘saved’ by you. Move on.
"Definitely don’t leave just because of peer-pressure, but also definitely make sure you haven’t accidentally slipped into a place where he feels safe and enabled to continue this behavior because you’re allowing it. 

I’m not sure why everyone here is so desperate for you to drop him and move on. Doing essentially all of the emotional/physical labor in the relationship is obviously not great, but you love this dude and he’s been through something incredibly traumatic. 

Do you guys still have fun moments? Or is he miserable all day not even trying to engage with you"
Stronger than anyone just by waking up? Bc his pain must be so much worse than anyone else on the planet? Almost everyone loses a parent at some point in life. Millions of people find ways to function despite their depression every day. Your bf isn't special and you're naive af if you think hes not just seeing how long he can get away with you being his caregiver.
"Honey, they aren't telling you to walk away because they don't understand love or because they doubt that you love him. They're begging you to love *yourself* enough to realise that your relationship dynamic has become unhealthy. That you're incredibly over-invested in a relationship that was pushed to become too serious too fast because of shared trauma bonding. You're acting like you're this man's wife, his full-time carer & responsible for him when that's not actually the relationship you have.

If even HIS family think you need to walk away, you really should at least talk this through with a therapist. If it's really true love, it will survive you at least stepping back a tiny bit & allowing him to take more of a lead on managing his own recovery with their help."
"I may be wrong, but feels like what gives you strength is more the idea you have of true love than love itself. Feels like you need to prove your love to yourself, him or the others and that's why you're doing it for the most part. 

Maybe there's some love that still linger in your heart for him, but that can't last forever if he doesn't reciprocate. You have your emotional needs too right?

If he can at least show his love to you and you're satisfied with the situation, then it's all good I guess"
Key word is WE and US do you feel like there is an US right now? What does he do to help you? How does he make your life easier not harder?
"If everyone is giving you the same advice, consider that you may be looking at things from a bad perspective, and they may be right."
"What other people say: you are enabling him. You are part of his problem. I am sorry.

That doesn't mean you should break up, but something needs to change. The alternative could be that everything collapses just at the moment that you have no energy and power  left to deal with that.

Furthermore, you should ask yourself if you would love him so much if you would have solved your own issues and are more confident and demanding as a result of that.

Take good care of yourself. 
I have a strong feeling that you will overcome all ypur troubles and will find peace and hapiness :)

Lots of luck!"
"I was once in a relationship where we both had undiagnosed and untreated depression. We were over as a couple long before I got help for myself, but he didn't do the same for himself. He came back into my life in a weird way and I immediately could feel him dragging me back under, so I cut him out of my life permanently for my own wellbeing.

When I asked my therapist if I had done the right thing, she said I have to ask myself that question, not her. For me, cutting him out of my life was absolutely the right thing to do.

Do not dismiss the concerns of your family and his entirely. You will know better than anyone that a person who doesn't want to helped cannot be helped, but you're also invested more deeply than even his family and that can warp your perspective. So, your biggest responsibility is actually to look after your mental health first. You cannot be there for him in the long-run if you are not first there for yourself. It is far easier for the unwilling party to drag down their partner than it is for the partner to pull them out. Depression is quicksand. It'll pull you down before you can pull him out if either of you are dealing with it in the wrong way. 

He is definitely dealing with it in the wrong way. Are you?

You must monitor yourself in a completely honest way. Are you are dragging yourself down? Are you enabling him by being a gilded cage in which he can hide from himself and the world without having to face himself? You must consider whether you are doing the right thing for either of you.

If you're not sure you can be fully honest with yourself, you should consider returning to therapy to give you a professional sounding board to help you monitor yourself and your actions in an honest way."
"So, I'm going against the grain and saying that love takes courage. It takes courage to stick around through the bad. 

I've been with my husband for almost 30 years and we've been married almost 23 years. We've been through a lot together. He stuck with me when all of a sudden I put on 50 pounds for no known reason (took 2 doctors about a year to figure out what happened). 

We got married, had our first kitty, who was our child, pass away unexpectedly, 9/11 happened, his dad passed, then just a few months later, his stepfather passed. Our first year of marriage was incredibly hard. I went into a deep depression when his step-dad died because I was close to him (he was the dad I didn't have). I barely got out of bed. He had to take care of our other kitty, our home, himself, and me. We stuck together. We made it through everything. I also refused counseling. But with my husband's love and encouragement, I went and it helped. 

We've been through a lot more throughout the years. My mother got divorced from her 5th husband. I had a couple of major surgeries, so did he. My mother eventually got married to a new husband. They were both major alcoholics. My mother got cancer. New step-dad ended up with heart failure. We had more deaths in our family, My step-dad passed, my mother moved, Covid happened. Husband's grandmother died just before covid. Both of my grandmother's died during covid times. My mother passed. Husband had major surgeries. 

We've had a lot of tough times but we've also had a lot of good times. Sometimes I give 70% and he gives 30%. Sometimes he gives 70% and I'm only giving 30%. But we make it through. 

If you think that you can survive the storm, then keep fighting for your boyfriend and your relationship. If you don't think you can continue, that's okay too. No one can make the decision but you. 

Blessed Be."
"It's not his fault that he's depressed, but being unwilling to go to therapy would be a deal breaker for me.

Have you directly asked him to go to therapy?"
"There’s so much wrong with this. 

You cannot help a person who won’t help themselves. You’ve literally tried and failed with the therapy. You don’t seem to realize that life isn’t black and white, and you can leave him while still being there to support him. 

I’m curious if when you went through your depressive episode was he cooking? Cleaning everything? Did he do your laundry for you? Did he make therapy appointments and try to force you to get better?

He’s absolutely in there, but it’s clear as day he doesn’t plan on coming out. You will run yourself to the bone thinking that sacrificing everything for love is healthy. 

I mean, what does *your* therapist have to say about all this?

ETA if you were stuck taking care of a narcissist then I can totally see why you think this is normal. But please compare your current situation to the one with your mother."
"Sometimes, love isn’t enough"
You know why airlines have you put your oxygen mask on first? Because you can't help anyone if you can't breathe. You have to take care of yourself somewhere in here because there is a breaking point where you will be suffocating. This is not sustainable.
"Do you think because he was there for you and your depression, you'd feel guilty if you didn't continue doing everything op?"
Why would he get better if he has you taking care of him like this?
"Foolish, reckless and naive to set sacrifice yourself for someone who refuses to get help. You are harming yourself for a man who refuses to get help. At some point your own health will suffer because of this relationship."
"I’m 25F. My man is 26M. We have a 6mo son. We’ve been together since January of 2020 and living together since September of 2020. We both struggle with depression and anxiety, combined with self destructive behavior on my part and substance abuse on my partner’s side. We’ve been through a lot together— including the passing of my man’s father also and moving over a thousand miles away from family and back because of our baby boy. We’re technically only girlfriend and boyfriend but we call each other “fiancé/fiancée” to people that don’t know us. We both have rings on our fingers that we wear every day without a second thought. Point being— we’re basically married, if only common law marriage was still around. 

One thing I have learned is that unless I absolutely love and care for myself first, I can not love and care for others — not properly. Imagine trying to save someone from drowning but you don’t even know how to swim. It does not work. Soon enough you will both be drowning. 

I have told my partner time and time again, even as we are now parents together— “you can not stay with me if I am dragging you down, if I am abusive, if I get to be too much, whatever it is; put yourself first so that our son and I get the best of you. We all deserve that.”"
"I hear you, and I understand what you're going through. But be careful. You might not be his helper at this point. You might be his enabler. 

Please male a deadline for yourself. If he does not get better, if he does not even start to work on himself and get outside help, when the time is up, you need to leave. 

The deadline could be 6 months from now, or one year if you want to be generous, but don't stay 5 years in this, or more.

The thing is, if you are the enabler, then you are screwing his life while thinking you help him. As long as you do everything for him, he doesn't need to get up and do anything. 

He can stay in this depressive state for years if he doesn't get help. And you're making it very easy for him to continue like this. 

I know you feel like you owe him from the past, but you also owe him to get his but moving. So think about what you're doing and why, and if it's really helping."
Does he know that you’re running yourself into the ground and still refuses therapy? If so then how loving is he really?
"If feel like if you truly loved him, you would stop enabling him and make it a condition of you staying with him that he gets therapy."
"I'm not saying you should leave him. But you should,  slowly, stop doing everything for him.  
Keep reminding him about getting help, but stop reminding him about brushing his teeth.  

You have 4 pets, do any need walks? Ask him as a favor to do so. It might help. 

Stop checking for things that only he uses that are running low. Wait until he notices. 

I do not have any experience with depression,  but one thing I know is that you can't help anyone who doesn't want to be helped.  

Stay with him, if you really think that's what you need to do, but be careful not to burn the candle on both ends. With your history on depression, who is going to help you and your precious pets if both of you are unable to do anything."
"I don't believe in so-called sacrifices and unconditional love. It's no longer sacrificed when it's exceeded your ability. And the unconditional love is especially just plain stupid. And it applies to everyone. Husband, kids, parents, siblings, friends. 

I'll be there throughout your darkest time, your lowest point, but you gotta do what you got to do. 
I'm not going to be everyone's caregiver for life just like that without any plans for the future or even more, being a lifetime caregiver unnecessarily."
"Your devotion is a beautiful thing to behold. But if he’s not willing to stand up and start walking through life with you, and take care of you as much as you take care of him, work as hard as you work, etc… 

You can’t accept that for yourself. It’s not your job to fix him. You will become so unhappy catering to his misery for the rest of your life. He needs to wake the fuck up. "
You risk making it too comfortable for him to get out of his own way.
"I don’t think you need to break up with him right away, but you may need to start putting in a timeline for him to get treated. If you give him an ultimatum, you need to follow through on it. You leaving may be the bottom that needs to fall out for him to start getting better. Right now, he’s extremely comfortable."
"I don't care what the others think, I think you're amazing and your loyalty is inspiring. Hang in there. I'm sure you're trying to get him to take his meds. Just be patient and persistent. Stay the course. I have faith in both of you."
"You’re lighting yourself on fire for someone you care about but they aren’t even looking for wood while you give them your warmth.  

Your fire won’t last forever.  

Your own history makes you want to help someone you care for get better, like you did.  But sometimes…. Being a helping hand enables them to not have to do all the work themselves.  I wouldn’t say leave him.  But you gotta take a break. 

I wish y’all luck,  and all the best.  Seems like the love is truly strong here."
"Yea I'd continue supporting him. Communicate on why he stays in one place. Maybe recognition of his mortality hit him that bad, will take a lot of work to move past that. You are obviously a great pair and support each other through thick and thin, I admire both of your devotions."
"I think OP's BF has the 'what's the point of any effort into \*anything\*, because I'm just going to die like my dad did, only earlier?' mentality going on. So he has no motivation to help himself. If there was only a way for OP to convince to help himself. He obviously knows the steps because he helped OP in the right direction. Now he has to do it for himself who never was depressed before (that we know) and can't see the forest for the trees. He seems like such a good guy too. Maybe OP he can read a couple of self help books or videos on YT."
"Desperately hanging on to something to prove everyone wrong no matter how much it hurts you… Interesting strategy, Cotton. Let’s see how it works out."
"The way I see it you just need to be there for him. You're doing the right things, he just needs to shake this off. If he's in therapy and taking meds something will click and make him snap out of it. Take care of your man and ignore the peanut gallery."
"Love is love. Hold his face in your warm hands, look right in his eyes, and tell him that you need him back. This is what woke me up. I do know where your head is. You are an angel."
"I know you don’t want advice, but I’m going to give it anyway because I hope to hell this helps you and your boyfriend.  

Take your boyfriend out of his comfort zone.  Go on a trip — a lazy weekend trip with at least two hours of driving to get there.  Stay at a B&B where you’re not going to get a safe, corporate grey color scheme.  Even if the frills on the curtains make you guys wonder what the heck the innkeeper was thinking, it will be worth it.  Go to a museum or two, go for a tour of something, go out for dinner and lunch.  Get out of your routines.  This will be the first step of many.  He has to get outside of himself to find his way through this."
"Honestly, I agree with you. I genuinely feel like people have forgotten what real, true love looks like. It’s self-sacrificing. Even detrimental. Sometimes borderline obsessive and can often be unhealthy. 

But how many ways can we explain that they just don’t see what we see? For them it’s just a set of circumstances, but for us we can SEE the person underneath it all. And we know that the person beneath all the layers of hurt and depression is so much more wonderful than anyone can really comprehend. THAT is what keeps us around and it’s so easy for people to judge from the outside. Give advice where none is wanted or needed. Sometimes we hang onto things that are broken because sacrifice means giving up something good for something even better later on. Especially since we have been there and know where others failed us. 

My husband is the same. He has problems that, right now, he’s not willing to address. But FFS that’s my husband. In sickness and in health. That was the deal. And I hate it when people tell me idk what I’m doing. I’m an adult. Stop questioning MY choices for MY life. I love him, isn’t that good enough? I’m willing to stay and sacrifice my happiness, that used to be honorable. What happened? No wonder our society is lonelier than ever. No one wants to deal with the discomfort and “unfairness” of having to be the carrier of the weight sometimes. 

OP, your boyfriend is lucky to have you. And you’re lucky to have had him when you needed him. And you’re wonderful for continuing to support him even when the whole world is telling you to give up on him. We will not give up, because they didn’t give up on us. That’s a measure of character, not a flaw. That’s love. Period."
"Yall are just straight up assholes. She took 3 years to improve, but god forbid the man takes a couple to improve. 

He did everything he could for her WHILE suffering himself. If this post was from him a year ago for his gf, yall would be saying drop the gf. 

Truth is, the commenters here are just straight up materialistic assholes. I hope you get all yhe love in the world OP, and dont listen to the salty commenters who are just jealous they dont have someone this caring in their lives. 

I feel bad you have to read through all these heartless assholes’ comments."
"My partner stayed with me, it lasted longer than in should have. He couldn't help me and I couldn't help myself. Scarry af.


When he had a low moment, I could help him because I had been there. 



I appreciate that he stayed and I appreciate him. We are now thriving and stronger and better partners for it.


Only you know if you can stay. Sounds like he's been there for you for a very long time. He needs you now. "
"He can't even brush his own teeth??????

Is he an adult?"
You don’t sound like you’re personally in distress about your relationship. You’re being told you should be. Don’t worry about what others think. You know this guy. Trust yourself.
"I am sorry that you are in this situation dear.. it’s not easy. Kudos to you for being so strong and for giving that unconditional love.

Let me ask you tho, are you here because you want someone to validate your stand, or are you here hoping that someone would make a strong point to negate your reasons?

Ask yourself that and it’ll simply answer which path you would want to take. 

Regardless of your decision, I hope that you’ll not forget to love yourself too, the way (or even more) that you have been loving your partner."
You can't fix him
"I feel this is your life and as long as you're not being abused and your therapist is checking on you, this is on you. But yes he's doing nothing for himself and this isn't right for him and for you. I would consider (always asking to the professional first) if pushing him in some different way may be useful"
"Honey, I say this with compassion. You do not know what love is. Your boyfriend is using you and dragging you down. You need to end the relationship and allow him the space to figure out his life because right now he is on cruise control while you basically take care of him. He needs the motivation to pick himself up and you aren’t it. Your actions are holding both of you back. As someone who is truly in love with their spouse- 1. Love is not the codependent mess you are in. 2. You are enabling his incredibly poor behavior. Everyone who acts like him has trauma. That is no excuse to act the way he is acting. 3. Someone who truly loves you will help lift you up when you need it and carry their own weight. He is doing neither of those things for you. 4. Love is not enough. You can love someone. That doesn’t mean it will be a successful happy relationship. 

He isn’t the one. Maybe he will be one day but he needs to be alone to dig himself out and pick himself up if he ever decides to do that."
"Nobody can be inconvenienced anymore. No one wants to fight for anything. Is it going to be hard on you in that situation? Yes. But if you feel it is what is right even though it’s hard, you do it."
"I get your feeling, you were on his Shoes and knows how it hurts when people leave when on you on your worst. Also love is not just a feeling, it's a feeling + a construction around it. Moreover, Both of you haven't their brain fully developed or just developed so the centering of feelings is a bit different. 


So see it maybe this way, you both have an unconditional love feeling but the whole responsibility of the relationship is on you, it won't functions or work at this point of the relationship if you don't put your effort to keep that whole relationship together and that's not okay and it's why people will tell you to leave him.

However,they forget what cptsd is also possibly your boyfriend grew up in a dysfunctional family,so both or you have a fear to be abandoned and are co-dependant what usually is in feeling a stronger feeling of love as an healthy loving relationship. 

I won't tell you to leave, these kind of relationship can work but it asks for both of you knowing their own flaws and put boundaries around it and it asks therapy on both side, so you are doing it but he's not and you need to accept that you can't help him and that he has to go to therapy because he's own flaw isn't your responsibility. 

So you should both discuss how you see the future and what is he willing to do to make the relationship work, so that the responsibility of the relationship falls on both of you in a seemly fair way because at this moment it's not and you will burn out from this ""savior complex"" , I was partly on your place too."
"He isn't willing to do anything. You are not helping him. You are enabling him. There is no *we* will overcome this. He isn't interested in overcoming it. 
Walk away."
"Sounds like he's dealing with major depression. He should be on medication ASAP. If he is too depressed to take it himself, you could maybe put some in his juice if he is OK doing it that way."
"I read a previous post, about how from a young age you had to take care of your mother and sister. The experiences of our youth impact our present and I’m worried you think caretaking and acts of service are mandatory in love. At the end of the day, who in your life is taking care of you?"
"Your commitment and dedication to him is so amazing and shows how much you love him. That said, it gets to a point where you start to enable him to take advantage of the situation. Resentment will build if he continues to refuse to help himself, and you deserve more than what you’re getting. Good luck."
"What would he do if something happened to you? Would he be able to take care of himself? 

God forbid, say you bust an ankle or something. Would he be able to help you then?"
"It sounds like you’re doing it less because you love him so much and more bc you like having a project. You acknowledge he isn’t doing anything to help himself, so you just like doing it for him"
"You're way too young to be in this kind of situation, all I can read in your post sounds like you're trying to convince yourself this is right and you know deep down is not.

Sacrifices should be from both of you, not just you. And you need to comprehen this some people don't want to be saved."
"I get your all for love viewpoint. Although, you do hopefully realize that doing all the work load for two, you will eventually hit burn out. And, what’s his motivation if you are ‘so happy’ to do it all anyway? Maybe he needs to contribute to the household to feel useful?"
"Everyone is right. You are probably treating him how you’d want to be treated if the shoe was on the other foot. His family is telling you if it were, he wouldn’t treat you the same. What you are doing isn’t love. It’s more likely to be a manifestation of whatever mental and social issues you have. 

It’s one thing if you were married for 20 years and he hit a rough patch. This is a young man you aren’t married to, who is struggling so much he can’t reciprocate. There is only you pouring all of your energy into someone who can’t give it back and may never. There is no “we” in this. 

If you love him give him space to heal, let him choose to be with you when he is in a healthy mental state. 

If you love yourself, talk to a professional about your own mental health, and why you feel the need to hold on to this boyfriend."
"This is for both of you:

We owe it to ourselves and to each other to work on our own shit, and also to not feel like shit.

Encourage each other to complete at least two things on the *daily list*…

Daily List:
-basic hygiene incl. brush teeth, wash face, wash hair in sink if possible
-food & water
-address at least one annoying thing (e.g. flickering lightbulb, dirty plate on bed table, etc.)
-fun, 5 minutes min.

You both will feel better, and you deserve to.
Good luck."
"I was your bf. I almost died when I was 22, and ended up with permanent lung damage and severe depression. My bf was amazing, and really helped me when I needed it. Except for the part where I got used to doing nothing, so I did. I was afraid to leave the house or do pretty much anything. The best thing he ever did was take a job where he had to be gone for weeks at a time. Just taking the garbage out was a huge accomplishment at first. But it felt really good to not be a sad lump all the time. I got on meds and started therapy and tried to start being a person again.

Your bf does not want to get better, so he will not. By now he should be on meds and in therapy. He should be trying. That doesn't mean he should instantly be better, but he has to actually try. You are a good person, but you cannot do this without his help. Honestly, sometimes the best thing we can do for a person is to stop helping. Your bf has no reason to get better since he has you doing everything for him."
"I can empathise. You love him to pieces and you're doing absolutely everything to look after the love of your life. You're doing a lot of juggling of looking after your partner but also looking after your own wellbeing. There will come a time when you may become completely burnt out with it all. 
I did the same for an ex partner for 13 years, someone who wouldn't seek help, someone who felt they didn't need help and I helped them and picked up the pieces but inevitably I got burnt out and I ended up resenting him and ended the relationship. Would an intervention work? I don't think these people in your life don't love their partners. They're just looking out for you. Take care of you."
"I was in the same state as your bf. I spent years barley able to function because of my depression. I had no desire to do anything to get better or even to help myself. The worst thing was that everyone enabled me to the point I had no reason to put in any effort to even try. It nearly destroyed my family by looking after me and it wasn't until was forced into the hospital for a week that I actually started to try to get better. Right now you are doing whst you think is best, but really are doing the worst thing for him."
How long do you wait for things to get better? It sucks but sometimes love just isn't enough.
You are his gf not his psychiatrist
"He’s a sink with an open drain. There will never be enough to carry someone who has no vested interest in saving themselves. I think it’s fair to give him some concrete actions like going to a therapy consult or whatever it is that will help, as a bare minimum. He has to be willing to get help."
Yeahhhh I felt the same and now I’m living with my mom with our three kids. If they don’t want to change or get better they won’t.
The problem isn’t that he is depressed. The problem is that he won’t do anything to fix it. People like this will suck the life out of you if you let them.
"At what point does help turn into enabling?  You sound truly compassionate, empathetic, committed, loyal and an absolute gem.  I understand depression too.  But I genuinely wonder how long is too long?  When does help turn into a new comfort zone for the one receiving it?  I dont know the answer to this, but I think it is something to maybe think about."
"You can’t fix someone who doesn’t want to be fixed, all you’re doing now is enabling him. If you’re in therapy, please talk to your therapist on what the best thing to do is for YOUR health."
"It’s almost cute how much youthful naïveté is in this post. 

>I don’t believe that there is too much sacrifice for love

I think you missed the part where you’re supposed to love yourself too, but maybe you were too busy getting off on being a martyr. That’s fun and exciting when you’re 24 with lots of energy and few life responsibilities, not so much fun after years and years and years of giving so much to someone who’s giving you nothing in return. You care so much about your boyfriend, but who’s paying attention to how much you’re sacrificing for this dead end relationship? Clearly he doesn’t give a crap."
"You need to help yourself, not him. You need to learn boundaries and when ""helping"" is too much. It's not your fault you did not learn that as a child. Alanon groups helped me learn that stuff. A good therapist can also help you. You can go to alanon even if he's not an alcoholic. When you drive your bf to a tberapist you made the appt for that he refuses to see-that is like someone covering for and cleaning up after their drunk partner.
You seem to not understand what ""enabling"" is and that is ok. Once you learn about it and apply your new non-enabling skills your life will get better."
Y'all are codependent. He needs meds and therapy. Non negotiable. Put your foot down before you both drown
Your family is right .
"I have PTSD and have been down the rabbit hole since 2012, I started to climb back out in 2019.  It’s not that I didn’t want to help myself or my spouse didn’t want to help me but I couldn’t see up!  I ever saw was dark no matter what time of day it was.  I didn’t take care of my self at all, I closed myself off from everything and everyone, I barely talked to my wife for two to three years.  Your partner needs medication and a lot of therapy and people that are willing to understand what he’s going through.  Sometimes depression can dig you a hole so deep you don’t know which way is up, you can reach out for help and touch nothing because you think your reaching you know your reaching but in reality you’re just sitting there inside your head.  For seven years I only left my house to outside to smoke I wanted nothing to do with anybody or the outside world.  Your guy has a long road to travel and he’s going to need a lot of support and encouragement from all sides."
"I chose to stay in a similar situation but I had children.

Things that helped him get out of the slump were me arranging therapy and going with him until he was comfortable going on his own. In some cases, I would do all the talking and simply refer to him for confirmation that what I was an accurate reflection of his feelings. I also arranged for us to go on walks together every evening. We would walk in silence sometimes but others he'd chat away as he felt more comfortable not looking at me. This would sometimes give me insight for the next therapy session.

The other thing I did was set one small task each day. It might be washing my car, unstuck the dishwasher, hand clothes out. Just having one thing to focus on meant he wasn't overwhelmed and made him feel like he was contributing. He didn't have the capacity to think for himself or make decisions so I did it for him.

My husband hasn't improved in fact he most likely has neurological issues which affect his mood and cognitive ability. 

It's not easy, but only you know your strength and what you can tolerate. Just make sure you take care of yourself too. Plan days where you just focus on you. You need to recharge your battery especially if you have your own issues."
You’re a good person. Remind him as often as you can that he has to meet you at least halfway. Get him into therapy. Take him to the doctor. Make sure he gets the help he needs to help himself. But always remind him at every step that if he isn’t laying down some throttle of his own then auxiliary thrusters can’t do much.
I think you are in denial...
"You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.. the point is he has no drive to do so, and it's dragging you down with him."
"So, you also have depression and are still doing everything. Why is it expected of you but not him? He is responsible for his mental health. It's great that you love and want to help him, but you can't sacrifice everything for him. There has to be a point where he helps himself and starts to contribute. Or else you burn out."
"My husband doesn't understand that I don't want him to save me but to help me, be supportive. I've always saved myself, I had no choice really. I got therapy and started to dig myself out. 

I don't think an ultimatum will work but a deep talk where you express yourself and what you need and getting to know what he needs. But he cam only really help himself. You don't need to drown."
"So what happens if he never gets better? Are you going to be his maid forever? You can stubbornly think that loving someone means you have to suffer for years, but that’s not true. Why is it fair that you have done so much for your mental health but he won’t? Why is that acceptable to you?"
"It may be time to temporarily step away. Sometimes people need a push to get out of that depressive hole. You're making it too comfortable for him. Why would he improve when he is taken care of in every aspect of his life? Make him a little uncomfortable. It's ok. You are enabling at this point. 

Ask him what the point of living through a near death experience if he's not willing to live his life."
"If my family or friends ever said that, I would seriously consider it.  They have a more objective view and would never interfere unless it they felt it was critical.  However some families just like to control the situation and people. They should not be involved. Should you listen? As always, it depends on the source.  Consider their points but it’s your life."
You're throwing your youth away. Better focus on yourself.
"I did everything you’re doing for my husband. He’s better now and walked out on me like I was a piece of trash now that he doesn’t need me anymore. I wasted 20 years of my life, and ruined my physical and mental health, thinking he would do better by me when he was better, and I’m the only one who is treated like vermin now, despite being the only one who was there for him and didn’t run and hide like little babies (his family and friends). Now those jerks, who did absolutely nothing to help either of us and stood by and watched me suffer, get to reap the benefits of my suffering. Please don’t make the mistake I did. Walk away before it’s too late."
"Oh sweetie. He will never get better if you keep doing things for him. Why should he. Maybe consider backing up a bit, not leaving  forever just something to light a fire under his ass and get him wanting to get better. If he doesn’t WANT to he won’t, no matter how much you do for him. He has to want it and he doesn’t right now or maybe ever. Maybe if he feels he might lose you he’ll at least make an effort to get better. He never will if you keep allowing him to wallow in his depression. Good luck."
He doesn’t know how to help himself.
"i think you should live in a way that aligns with your principles and what you believe

if you are okay with misery and suffering in the name of love- who am i or anyone else, to tell you otherwise?"
Perhaps he needs to see a grief counselor. Or maybe an intensive outpatient?
"At this point, it doesn’t sound like supporting anymore. It sounds like enabling. If you continue to do all of this for him then he will stay right where he’s at. I agree that you need to walk away. Not forever. But give him enough space to HAVE to want to get better. He is going nowhere with you doing literally everything for him. There is a huge difference between you supporting him and him just plain taking advantage of the situation and using his conditions and trauma to excuse it."
"Ok so I haven’t read the comments on purpose. I just came to say it seems like you’re taking great care of him and yourself and you know the situation and what’s going on. I say this because I’ve got similar diagnoses, and since a breakdown (loooooong story leading up to, as these things go lol) I’ve been doing the work I need and asking for help. I started that before I met my current bf, and he has his own stuff, particularly addiction so we have similar ways of approaching things. So it can be cyclical with us too, and he’s the first partner I’ve ever had who I communicate and connect on the same level as. Long story short, he supports me through the hard stuff, particularly grief and the trauma work I’m doing, and I supported/support him with getting (and staying, I trust, & I hope) sober. And before then (he needed medical detox) he knew and I told him, that I know it’s a journey he needs to start and do by himself, and that I will support him through it. However there may be a point if he doesn’t get sober that I reach my limit. 

So with that in mind, and with the intention of support and helping (I’m good with if it’s not relevant and/or not needed) I wanted to say that you are doing the right stuff, dealing with it in the way you need to to stay healthy. The people seeing it from the outside have your welfare in mind, which is also great, as long as it doesn’t cross any lines. And you know that he needs to ask for help, he needs to start the process, and if you need to gently remind him that’s up to you entirely. And if you reach your limit, that’s again entirely your decision and for you to get to with the support you have set up around you. 

And something that to me seems simple now, but I didn’t know what I didn’t know until I did:

Sometimes we grow together and sometimes we grow apart and either one is ok. 

Oh and it’s also ok to not know (that one was hard for me too lol)

I wish you the best OP"
"OP, you can be right about what love means - about it being worthy of sacrifice - and still be wrong about what your bf needs that love to look like rn. What does your therapist say?"
"It sounds like he needs specialized *grief counseling*, not just any random anti-depression therapy.\^\^"
You can’t make someone start caring about their life by loving them into it. Sometimes you have to be the one to step back so they can truly understand what they are losing out on in life
"Hey. i'm different.i have a success story for you girl!! My Soulbond was laid up real bad with depression. It was alot of work. But he's working full time, changed diet, sober, not-suicidal, investing, saving, spending time with our son, 1000000000 things now!! Has his own therapist. Fuck. I knew he was ""in there"" & had the potential for greatness...if he'd only listen. 


My advise, tell him that his life is more important to you than it might be to him right now, tell him you ardent leaving, tell him he deserves you're love & you'll love him until he loves himself again. 


I'm borderline, bipolar & adhd...ect. 
On meds & therapy weekly with group & classes. 
I tell him everything i learn. At first he was against all of it. Now...mood stabilizer and testosterone. 


Had your man had doctor visit anytime recently? I might thunk what medically can we rule out: thyroid can cause mood problems, low testosterone is awfully depressing and awful for men. 


Does he have a best friend? Reach out, invite him over, remind him that the world is still spinning, and people support him no matter what. Be beef


*if he becomes abusive...i think you know what to do. 


But as for the fam & friends.... sounds like it time they stfu. Set a boundary that you'd like them to keep their opinions to themself about your man. Tell them that it's innapropriate how they've spoken to you and you feel let down by them. Inform them if they cross the boundary you will end the confederation on your end. Walking away. Hanging up. Um....idk but you've heard their words, they will be jarred that you're seeing a boundary prob. Be prepared for ""but i only said that to look put for you"" instead of ""ok, i understand"". Realize they ardent getting what they wanted, so they will not be happy @ first. I hope you don't get any ""you'll see""s out of anyone. Tell them you appreciate them caring but @ this point, it's off the table. It's your decision. 


Now, if you choose to do this.... realize you can't talk about him anymore to everyone unfortunatly. That will make thhem think it's their busibess again. 


Keep yourself validated in a journal & congratulate yourself for making a big decision. To be an adult. Not care what others want for your life. You got this. "
There is supporting and then there is enabling him. You need to give him a deadline to get to a doctor and start therapy tell him you are willing to drive him until the meds start to kick in. If you don't give him a swift kick in the pants he is not going to get better. Depression can be like that where you can't find the energy to get help but you can't also let him stew in it. You cannot set yourself on fire to keep others warm that will destroy you
"You know, there is a fine line between helping and enabling. 

At some point you are going to run out of options both for yourself and him. When you are burnt out, who will be there to pick up the pieces? 

You’ve been proactive about your mental health which is excellent. He has to as well otherwise this is you life with him. What you have now is how it will be or worse if he doesn’t attempt to help himself as well. 

What will it cost you in the long run? He has no incentive to do anything because you do everything. 

You’ve paid him back. You don’t owe him more than he is willing to give himself."
"I can tell you that it’s a good idea to listen to what the people who love you say about your significant other. That’s not to say you should break up because they think that, but you need to weigh their opinions because they know and love you.

When my now-ex and I were dating, not one of my friends or family members thought it was a good idea. No one. They were very blunt with their (correct, as it happens) opinions. I loved him and was willing to overlook a whole lot of crap because I wanted so badly to be with him. He turned out to be an abusive asshole. 

He’s also the father of my wonderful son who’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. And he was a terrible father to our son. So in hindsight, I can’t say I would take their advice (but only because I wouldn’t have my son — he’s the only good thing about that 10-year hellscape), but I would not go blindly into the relationship the way I did back then. And if I’d been stronger going in, it might have been easier to get out."
"Not my business to tell you to leave or to stay, that’s on you. Please take some time each day to do something just for you though. 2 minutes in the sun outside, eat a piece of chocolate and don’t share, smile at a stranger, let your animals love you. I’d his bucket is empty and you’re refilling it, who is filling yours? These little things might just be drops, but even drops have some magic."
"My husband committed suicide last year, after a long battle with depression and other mental health issues. I now know the battle was going on much more severely and much longer than I ever realized.

He and I have both fought depression for a long time. The past few years were the worst, for both of us. Frankly, in retrospect, it was only a matter of time before one or both of us lost that fight. Neither of us was getting the help we needed outside of each other (e.g. therapy) and as cliché as it sounds, you can't pour from an empty cup.

I say this from a place of love, and from personal experience. If he's not getting the help he needs on his own, you need to reevaluate the relationship. I don't mean ""you should walk away"" - at least not without doing everything within your reasonable ability to help him, to the extent that it doesn't break you in the process.

I loved my husband with all my heart. He was my life, my heart, my soul. I would have done anything to keep him here. But he wouldn't let me in enough, or allow me to get him the help he needed. He wasn't reaching out for help from anyone else either. I was stuck in torment every day. It was terrifying and painful and exhausting. I suffered deeply and those scars will take a very long time to heal.

If he isn't willing or open to getting help for himself, consider what that may mean for the relationship, for him, and for you.

This is the worst kind of situation to be in. The person you love most is slipping away from you and it feels like this time, you may not be able to bring him back on your own. He needs help. He needs to be willing to receive help from someone who isn't you. From a mental health professional. You can't be his only support system, especially since you have your own struggles too.

I'm not saying he's not worth it. I'm sure he is worth it to you. You're the only one who can make that call. But he may be beyond your ability to help him by yourself.

I desperately hope he gets help. Sending you love and support and good vibes."
STOP ENABLING THIS PERSON. Separate. Get back together after he manages X.
"He needs to be inpatient in a hospital. My ex girlfriend was the same, I was essentially her carer for over a year and paid all our bills while she dealt with crippling depression & mild psychosis. I kept saying it was okay because we're in love, we have a lovely life ahead of us if we can just get through this tough spot (her cheating on me constantly and emotionally abusing me lol. Couldn't see it at the time.) Then she started getting slightly better and dumped me lmao. 

Normally I'd say ultimatums aren't healthy but what he's asking of you now isn't fair and he isn't able to offer you a healthy relationship. I would say that unless he agrees to intensive treatment you're going to have to leave for your own wellbeing. 

Ask his parents if they can help pay for inpatient treatment in a hospital. I think at least offering him the opportunity is a good idea, you want to give it a shot. His brain is actively sabotaging him and doesn't want him to get better right now so try not to take it personally if he choses not to.

And I hope you're taking care of yourself and have outside support too ❤"
"My ex was also traumatized by a life or death experience. It made his behavior erratic. He would not go to therapy. Some days it was all love and other days it was not. He depended on me heavily for everything. Emotionally, financially, etc. He did not put effort into bettering our relationship. 

The things we experience do not justify our behavior towards others. They are a cause, not an excuse. 

I am very happy my ex and I broke up. And, though there it was a hard first year for him, I think he is a much better person now because of it. He got into therapy and secured a good job. He even started paying me back for the money I provided him during our relationship. Don’t expect that leaving him is going to ruin his life. If it does, that is HIS decision. 

Do not stick around with something who puts no effort towards you. Relationships should be eb and flow. Not all eb."
"I do think it is admirable that you care so deeply for him. However, he has to fend for himself. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make 'em drink. Only you've dragged the water to him and are holding his hand while he drinks. You need to express concern that he needs help, more than you can give, and if he can't. Then you gotta listen to his family. Tell him you miss when he would cook. That you know how much it helped you to get on meds and go to therapy, but seeing him struggle so much makes you wish he'd do the same. I know you don't want advice, but this post seems more like a cry for help or at least trying to convince yourself that this is fine. Don't get to a point where you resent him. Eventually, you'll have to understand that if you love him, let him go. Right now, you're doing yourself a disservice by being so adamant that you can do everything. Yes, you could very well be right, and he could get back on his feet and prove everyone wrong. However, when his family is telling you to leave him, that is when you need to listen. They care about the both of you and can see he is dragging you down with him."
One day you’ll realize you can’t save someone who doesn’t want to be saved. He is a literal sinking ship with no life vests on board. He’s drowning and he’s going to take you down with him.
Hope he makes it out. <3 Godspeed.
Info; have you talked about this situation with your therapist?
"Have you ever thought of listening to the people in your life? Maybe they are on to something, idk 🤔"
"So they are afraid you are enabling rather than supporting? Is he taking medication for his depression? A supporter would ensure that is happening rather than not, imo. Infantilizing someone by doing everything for them can be changed to waiting to see if action occurs and when it doesnt asking a multi choice question to spur action. For instance ""Are you getting a shower first or are you going to make coffee?"" to get him out of bed. Doing this gives him positive actions to be involved in rather than passively following orders.

I feel like this would be good for both of you and I wish you both well."
"As long as you are comfortable living this way forever, keep on keepin' on.  

If you are doing all of this with the expectation that he will eventually bounce back, you might be in for some major frustration in the future.

I am not giving advice to break up or leave him...just make sure your expectations are in line with what is currently happening.  

""He loved and took care of me at my lowest and I am happy to do the same for him.""  And then make sure you get support to help you for when the burden of daily life gets to be too heavy (house keeper, pet sitter, grocery delivery, etc...)"
"I admire the devotion. I wish you will get through this together. And remember, the stars shine the brightest in the dark"
"Having problems with your own mental health I see how him and how much you love him is very important. Breaking up against what you feel in your heart is something I feel could break you. And only you live in your head and your life. People have a tendency not to see their ""help"" as potentially harmful.

His unwillingness can be that any decision paralyses him. Because doing anything is a decision. Two hard years and a brain that may have a small damage. The stress in losing his dad can have made that worse. 

Try to see if he is willing to talk about how making decisions feels and try to get him to make small decisions by picking between two things that both work for you. It can be as small as picking the scent on the soap for the bathroom. Red or yellow bell peppers with dinner. The fat % in the milk. Making choices that aren't life or death. 

This is not based on him being your partner, just him being an important person you care about and my own experience. I hope this can help you both."
I hope things get better quickly! Don't forget to take care of yourself too. He's lucky to have you and I'm sure he appreciates you even though he's not in a place to show it rn
"Sounds like you both need therapy. You're enabling behaviour doesn't make you ""strong"" or enforce your love for him the way you think it does...which is sad because you obviously care very deeply for him."
"The thing about mental health is that you can only fix yourself, no one else can do it. Whether that's partners, family, therapists; they can help give you the tools to do it and give you comfort and a safety net, but the work has to come from yourself. He is not doing that, and you are enabling that."
"If this is where you want to be, then be here. 


The difficulty is that your boyfriend needs something that will break his daily patterns in a major way. That doesn't have to be you leaving - you've thrown in with what sounds like an incredible guy outside of this depression - but if he's deteriorating and not willing to take action, then unless he changes his perspective he will slide downward. 


That might happen on its own - or some external event might wake him up to how bad it is - or it might not. I don't know that leaving him would fix anything for him, I suspect not, but the drive to improve has to come from him."
"You ""think"" with your heart. Stop. The brain is the tool for this."
"Just make sure that you continue to better yourself as you help him. Don't let him drag you down. You're doing what you feel is best. The only thing I am going to give advice on is this. I won't condemn you, because I have been there too. Just make sure you don't let him drag you down. I'll be cheering you both on from the other side of the screen."
"He needs professional help, not a mommy girlfriend taking care of everything for him so he doesn’t have to even try to get better. 

Your devotion is commendable. You don’t have to walk away or give up but you should be trying to get him the help he needs to get better so he can actually participate in your relationship as a functional adult instead of leaving you stuck in a caretaker role. That’s not fair to you."
"If you refuse to walk away because of your own reasons, I suggest you make sure you are maintaining and not reducing your own therapy. 

Also, please be sure to practice appropriate self care. Personal time, personal hobbies, relaxation outside of your partner so you don't experience burnout. 

If you feel yourself getting burnt out, you need to address it immediately, even if it just involves taking vacation away from your partner for a week or 2. 

Do not try to be super woman. Sometimes, you have to prioritize things in terms of what is better for your mental health."
"I say this with love, and not as any kind of advice:

You are not required to set yourself on fire to make sure someone else is warm.  Not now and not ever. 

Best of luck with everything, OP."
"**I hope you read this. It has advice, but it’s how to help him, not to dump him.**

Look, I have a chronic illness myself, and an alphabet soup of mental health conditions, so I kinda get what he’s going through. I’m not going to tell you to dump him, because my husband takes good care of me, despite a number of issues relating to depression, anxiety, CPTSD, OCD, Bipolar 2, and some other physical issues I have. He doesn’t complain. He makes me think of how you two have taken care of each other during low points.

However… he needs to work on himself. If you keep doing everything for him, he’ll never get the push he needs to help him climb out of this rut. Being active by doing chores and such can give a little boost of accomplishment, which can be very productive toward recovering. He needs to help care for the pets, because helping small creatures thrive and receiving their affection can also be a good start. Only a little at first, like doing the laundry or taking pets for short walks could help him work through his pain, and as he starts getting used to doing tasks again, more chores and ‘normal’ daily living can be added. Do the stuff with him to help him be a little more confident; slow baby steps are the way to go. He’s wounded, but you doing this sort of thing with him can start healing for both of you.

You say you’ve got therapy and medication; does he? If not, he needs to start; it’s very important that he starts tending his own mental health. In the end, he has to *want* the professional help, or it won’t do much good. Maybe have sessions together so he doesn’t have to face this stuff alone. Face the problems side by side; you’re a team.

I think staying with him through this challenge is for the best, and as long as you work with him and he takes care of his mental health, this relationship can slowly recover and be healthier for it. Don’t forget your own self care!

I wish both of you the best of luck. This must be a huge struggle for both of you, but you can help him start managing things again. Take great care of yourselves and each other, just like you have been. You’re stronger together."
This sounds like a toxic codependent relationship. Hope you both take the time to help yourselves so you can be better partners to each other.
"You can love somebody with your whole heart and they can still not be the person for you. I loved my ex but we were very toxic for one another. I loved my mom and would have given my entire life for her but that love wasn't enough to erase all of the bad things. 

I believe I have undiagnosed BPD, CPTSD, and Insomnia. I have diagnosed Anxiety and Depression, I have been with my husband for 5 years and a lot has happened in that time. A lot of life altering, soul shattering things. Most days, I wish I could have a permanent nap but I still get up everyday and fight. My husband deserves a partner who's present, who helps take care of our pets, our house, and our marriage. I struggle every day but every day I also strive to get better and be better, not just for me but for my husband, that's how much I love him."
"You don’t have to leave him right this second, but I would definitely recommend having a serious conversation with him where you tell him you cannot continue on like this. Tell him he must get help because this isn’t healthy for either one of you and that you’ll have to walk away if he cannot start trying. I understand you love him, and it does sound like he did a lot to help you, so I get why you don’t want to just leave. But this is a bad situation for both of you. He has begun relying on you for literally everything, and you have become his caretaker and enabler. He must begin doing the work to get through this if you want a chance for your relationship to continue."
Well cool but right now you are the only one giving in this relationship. How long is there gonna be enough water in the well to keep pouring?
"I have no input on whether you should stay with him but for the record this isn't what love is, this is called enabling."
[removed]
"It's not about what you're doing but his lack of willingness to do anything. 

As the old saying goes, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.


Maybe have a sit down with him and a serious chat about the strain it's putting on you and while you know and understand you can't keep going on this way, he either needs to accept and actively get help or you need to walk away for your own sanity. 


Sometimes love isn't enough."
Yikes. I mean it sounds like he doesn't put effort into getting on his feet again. Sounds like coddle and hold his hand instead helping him put effort into getting better. He's weighing you down.
"Accelerated TMS is showing really promising results and is viable for many where other treatments aren’t possible.. such as Ketamine.
There is a Tim Ferriss podcast episode (10 year random show ) that shares some info on TMS and the results for depression and anxiety. Good luck"
"I'll preface this by saying I'm not giving advice, just a thought or two from a woman in a similar situation. You clearly love each other a lot, I can tell that much. And I can certainly relate. I have a fiance who was with me when I was facing homelessness and grief and loss and more. Now that he's struggling, I'm sacrificing a lot to be there for him. That's love. I agree I don't necessarily think that leaving your bf is the right move. Relationships look different to the people inside them. So, when your parents or his parents tell you to leave him... They're saying that with an outside perspective. A lot of time, outside perspectives are good, but I'm not sure that's the case here. Sometimes an outside perspective can illuminate you to mistreatment or toxicity, but from what you've said, that doesn't seem the case at all. You're very adamant that he's been with you at your lowest, which means he truly does love you. I don't know if you've talked to him about your exhaustion and how this is all affecting you. But just a teeny tiny bit of advice if you're willing to hear it, that might be his wake up call. He's sacrificed for you in the past, he loves and cares for you. If you show him what all this is doing to you, it might be the push he needs to get some help and start working on himself."
"You dont have to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.

I get it you love him and want to take care of them but i think you guys should start having some hard conversations about him starting to get help for himself.

i just dont want you to end up burnt out and resentful because you have so much on your plate. He does need to step up and start getting the help he needs which i understand feels almost impossible in the midst of depression but it is possible and you know that because you did it."
Why come to this sub if you don’t want anyone to comment…like write the shit in your notes app if you need to vent lol
Enabling vs helping. Sometimes one needs to take their crutch and get out of the way so another can seek the help they ACTUALLY need.
"As someone with a chronic illness, it sounds like he is doing his best.

He'll understand if you leave. He probably already has fears of holding you back.

If you leave, leave on your terms.  Shut down everything everyone else says. Fuck'em.  You know they just want to cast him aside because they don't want to deal with HIM being sick. It'll actually hurt him more if you leave under their influence. Trust me on that.

I've gone through it. How everyone looks at him like a lazy ass and a loser. How they kinda wish he would die just so they didn't have to see him sick. It fucking sucks, but he'll understand."
"So according to all the wise people here. You should leave him and perhaps leaving him is helping him. 

First scenario: You take their advise and leave him and he picks himself up and gets better, but he never forgives you for leaving him at his lowest or maybe he does and understands why you did it. 

Second scenario: You leave him and it gets worse, his father left (died) and you the most important person in his life also leaves and then he decides he can't take anymore and attempts to end it all. You won't forgive yourself and none of the wise people on here will console you in person cos they don't know you and they don't care to be honest. 


Third scenario: You reduce your care for him but keep your watchful eyes on him just enough for him to do stuff himself. You're present but not too present and see what happens. Maybe he gets better, maybe not. Worth a try. 


In the end YOU DECIDE."
"Here's the thing. I suffer from clinical depression. A couple of years ago, there was a 6 month stretch where I was practically catatonic. My brain was telling me to end it because I was such a burden to everyone around me, especially my husband. I wasn't capable of doing anything beyond sleeping 12+ hours a day and then sitting on the couch staring at the middle distance. My husband took care of absolutely everything. He made sure there was something I could eat in the house with next to zero effort. He'd encourage me to shower and brush my teeth and made sure I had clean clothes. He'd call and check on me during the day and make sure my friends and family did too. But I was trying to get better. I took my meds regularly, talked to my doctors and worked to get better. You absolutely cannot save someone from themselves. Depression SUCKS and it lies to you but, you have to fight that if you can (I realize that some people cannot). This guy is not doing anything to get better. What happens if you cycle down again and there's no one to do all the work that you're doing? That would be DIRE. I get that you love him, I get that he was supportive in the past. But, now, he's not being a partner at all, and not even trying to get to a place where he can be one again."
Anyone got a TLDR?
Oh brother
"You're his mother, not his girlfriend. Best of luck to you"
"Only you know him. You love him and he loves you. He clearly needs you now as you’ve needed him before. There’s nothing wrong here. Just make sure you’re taking care of yourself too. Even if that means distancing yourself from negative energy from those around you. Make sure you can rely on yourself. Do what you can. But don’t overwork yourself more than you have to because you know this can go on for some time. I support you, you’ve got this."
"This is one of those situations where everyone, including you, is correct. He’s sick and he needs help but he’s unwilling to get it. He may be unwilling to get help as long as you stay with him but at get worse if you don’t stay. You say WE will get through it but as others pointed out, there is no ‘we’ right now, only you. I completely get dating to marry and my husband was incredibly sick when we were dating. To the point that he literally died on the side of the road and I had to perform chest compressions for almost 10 minutes. We had the same worry you had about brain damage and he took. Months to even be able to sit up or swallow food after his heart transplant. I get it. After all that and Covid, some really terrible stuff happened in our lives and he really struggled. Every drop step I the way the only thing I demanded was that he fight for himself and for us. There were points where he was barely squeaking by but he was fighting. Compare that to the months before he was diagnosed when I begged him daily to go to a doctor and the former was much easier to deal with than the latter, even though it was so much worse in every other way. What does he want? Have you asked him? Does he want you to stay or is he hoping you’ll leave? Does he want you to live like this and love someone like him? Does he think you deserve better? (you do) he needs to start making choices out you will ultimately fail even if you don’t leave."
"I wish you luck and send support. Nobody will be able to change your mind anyway, so I send you a warm hug if it helps. You've got this. Ask for help if you need to. 

You're stubborn and strong, I like you."
Ok so continue as you are then - all the best
"I think you need to take a step back from all the help or he will never stand for himself.

 I can empathize so much with this, my ex is still living with me and depending on me because I held them up but didn't hold them accountable because I didn't want them to suffer. 
My ex before that was abusive, predatory and has unmedicated schizophrenia and refused to get help till I left.

because I made these people feel like they could just keep on relying on me because I didn't want anybody to hurt, I'm a terrible people pleaser to my own detriment.

I don't think you should leave, but space (for a while, not forever) could help him get the motivation to get better for himself with the aid of therapy."
Happiest Redditor couple
"I am sorry for what you are going through. I know a lot of people don’t like to hear what I have to say but I am going to say it anyways. TURN TO GOD! I went through some deeeep depression and my mother in law kept pushing God on me. At first, it felt annoying but eventually I opened up my heart to him and invited him into my life and my marriage and it was the best thing that could’ve happened to me. Jesus is the way 🙏"
"OP, I am not a therapist. A lot of people here are telling you that you & your BF are co-dependent, and that you leaving him will actually help him. But you have made it clear in your post that you aren’t interested in leaving, which you clearly see as abandoning him after he was there for you for the first two years. 

Your BF suffered the one-two punch of almost dying himself, and then losing his father to the thing that almost killed him. I cannot imagine the grief he has been dealing with, and it’s no wonder he’s depressed. I feel like he lives every day with the low-level fear (or maybe overwhelming fear) that he will die that day. That is a lot for the brain to process. In the intervening years, he has fallen into a depression so deep, you have to remind him to brush his teeth. Your BF, as you obviously know, needs professional help. Do you two still live with his parents? Because if so, living with the family who believes asking for mental health help or taking medication makes you weak is working against everything you are doing to help your BF. His family is even telling you to leave him. You know if you do, they won’t help him. Everything they are doing is inhibiting any progress you might make. You need to get out of that house.

As for your BF, you need to start encouraging him to do things for himself or to *help* you do things. When it is time to do laundry, say to him, “Come with me. We’re going to do laundry!” Make him go with you to the laundry room and help you, even if that means watching you at first. After you do that a few times, try handing him the basket of dirty clothes and saying, “Can you throw these in the washer for me? You remembered how we did it; right?” Don’t treat him like a child but help him like he’s a child. Do you know what I mean by that? Also, do that with other chores, like making dinner or making the bed or cleaning the bathroom or going to the bank or grocery store. Get him involved. Some days he may not be up for it, and at first he might say no or just ignore you, but you doing everything is, as others have said, enabling him to do nothing, and as a result he is not getting better.

You can’t do everything for him. You are only one woman, and not only don’t others help you, they encourage you to give up and leave. Yes, your BF needs professional help, so you have to encourage him to get there. Keep it a secret from his family, if need be. Tell him it will be your secret until he feels strong enough to tell people. Remind him of all the wonderful ways he helped you through your depression and how much better you feel now, and tell him you want that for him.

It’s possible you cannot help him. But I understand that you don’t want to give up on him. You’ve been through some shit together; he was there for you when your life was crumbling; you love him and want him to get well. Do you still see a therapist? Talk to your therapist about what you should do. As if they know someone who can help him. Maybe you can schedule appointments together, and you can tell his family he is driving you to therapy. But somehow he needs to get past being told getting help is weak so he *can* get the help he clearly needs. 

His family sounds kind of shitty, actually. Why would anybody actively work *against* help and treatment for someone they love? That makes no sense to me. 

Keep trying to help him, but make it more of an interactive help, where he is working with you. It might not work, and in another year, you make have a difficult decision to make. But I hope he breaks out of this depression and gets help. You sound like a good soul. Just don’t break yourself trying to fix him.

Hugs! 🫶🏼"
"Why people who don’t have energy to brush their teeth or shower of change clothes always have so many pets? Unless they are pet rocks, they need so much physical activity, mental stimulation, also good food and clean environment"
"OP- get the book ""Boundaries"" by Cloud and Townshend and READ it- if you grew up in an abusive situation, it is very likely you donteven really understand how important they are. And remember, the only thing you can do is change yourself and the way you think/live. I also thought I could love my ex enough to fix him. That's not how people work, though. And you are treading a very slippery path. Either way, I truly hope the best for both of you, and I hope your story ends in a way that is positive for the both of you. Love is a two-way street for a reason."
"Just curious, why did you come here asking for advice on another post if you didn’t want it? Like not judging, I’m just genuinely curious."
"You can't love him enough or do enough to help him out of this hole. You know this because you've crawled out of your own hole. 

I know it's hard to hear but right now you are enabling him. He doesn't need to go out and ""get help"" because you are doing everything he needs to stay alive. He can't hit rock bottom unless he is allowed to. 

You are setting yourself on fire to warm your BF, you are destroying your own mental health for someone who is not helping themselves. 

Your friends and family are right, you need to step back, focus on yourself and let him drown. I know it's hard but you aren't responsible for what happens to him, all you are doing right now is delaying the inevitable and the longer he is allowed to stay in this state, the harder it will be to pull himself out of it."
"The cruelty in the comments makes me want to vomit, Op I assure you that if it had been a man talking about his partner all the comments would have told him to find a way to help her, but since he is a man then he doesn't deserve pity, he doesn't deserve to being loved, this means being men, having a society that dumps you at the first difficulty because you are just a burden. For my part, I can tell you that it is truly praiseworthy that you are there for him, as you yourself say, he did for you, in this world of heartless individuals who only aim for personal satisfaction and are extremely selfish, as many in the comments, that's really commendable, having said that it's clear that you can't wait forever, at some point otherwise you won't be able to take it anymore, it's time you sat down with him face to face and explain to him how you're struggling and how It is necessary for him to wake up and decide to fight, to cure himself, to do therapy, because you can no longer shoulder all the weight of both of you, and therefore if he believes in this relationship, then he must fight for it and also for himself, also because if you always take care of everything, you don't push him at all to have to do something and you enable his "" depression"", because he has someone who does everything for him, things have to change to continue this relationship, that's for sure."
"None of those who are commenting are understanding you. It's not a good idea to vent your immense love here. I hope that with time, your beloved one recovers...but also encourage him to take therapy. It's nice to have someone at your side who looks after you and he's lucky for that, but you must also actively focuses on involving a specialist in this with you. Good Luck to both of you!!! <3 <3 <3"
I didn’t come here for relationship advice. Frankly I don’t care what anyone thinks about our relationship. I came here to get something off my chest. That’s it.
"You are an amazing partner! That fact that you’ve been in that dark hole before gives you knowledge of where his mind is at and gives you an insight that many people don’t have. You have empathy and compassion for him and what he’s currently going through. 

While it is true, he is not helping himself, but maybe he’s just not quite there yet. You are the one constant in his life right now. That’s a good thing. Just know that if things turn for the worst for him, none of it is your fault. You are doing the best for him. You are his rock. Just be there and love him today. Do it again tomorrow when he wakes up. Rinse and repeat. 

Encourage him everyday to try something new from going for a walk with you to reading a book to trying a new hobby like painting or pottery (creative art is great medicine for the depressed mind). Do these things with him, at least to start."
"If you’re not interested in biased opinions from people unhappy in their relationship or unable to even have one altogether, you’ve come to the right place."
"Please OP read it...

Please please please.... Don't leave him.... I am begging you....

After reading all this I can say that he is not bad, he is really good.
And those people who are saying you should leave him, just think about all the things he has done for you. He really loves you.

It's not right to leave the one you love bcs he has mental problems. You should help him.

You just can't break a relationship of 4 years. Please don't.

It's easy to break relationship but it's really hard to make a relationship. So don't break it.

Please don't hear these comments and break up with him.....

Bcs breaking up with him may give adverse reaction. He may turn suicidal bcs he is already depressed. When he sees that the only person that cared about him is leaving him, he may feel super broken and may end up committing suicide..... 

In a relationship you are supposed to help each other. So please continue to help him...
And another thing, try to make him do some of his work, he may become lazy 😂. 

Please don't break this wonderful relationship. He has given you a better life, so you shouldn't leave him....

Those people who are saying you to break up... Do they know the ""Meaning of Love""... 

You need to do some sacrifices and he also sacrificed for you.


I am from a traditional Buddhist family that's why I may sound old.... I m sorry, but I just believe that 
""A person have only one soulmate"""
"I have never read a story here that comes closer to what some may describe as unconditional love. I really wish you both the greatest outcome. I am totally rooting for you. 

Yes, it is true, nobody knows what will happen, nobody knows the future, may be they are right and you are wrong, but let me tell you none of these people have ever come close to what you both have.

So let time do the thing and see where it takes you. But do not let other people tell you what you want to get out of this experience. Play for the Win. Give your best. Don't expect anything, but accept every outcome. There is no other ""secret sauce"" to win.

You make your own rules. And you are already far far ahead of most of us, don't look back. Do what you have to do and enjoy wherever it takes you. In the end you have only to life with yourself and you can be proud of what you have already achieved. You are so strong. Please teach us how you got this strong? We should all listen to you and learn from you. How are you so good in this thing called love?"
Why should he save himself when he has someone who does it for him all the time
She will end up burned out either staying her whole life also depressed either leaving but feeling empty from giving too much for years.
You can lead a horse to water…
"completely 100% agree with this. my first two relationships were like this, i loved them so so deeply and felt exactly the way OP felt, held the same view and did the same work. however i failed to realize that it doesn’t matter how hard i love them, how hard i take care of them, how much i push them to start working on their mental health. they have to be the ones to hold themselves up, pick themself up, do the work for themselves. 

i don’t regret anything i had done for them, i still hold the same views to an extent. but as you said there comes a time when you have to realize that you are enabling them, and sometimes the best thing you can do for someone you love is take a step back. not saying to distance or break up, but just take it a little easier, give them a little room to grow on their own. it hurts like hell to do that, and it’s fucking hard because all you want is to give them the WORLD, give them everything have ever wanted. but sometimes you have to do hard things BECAUSE you love them so much."
"Its like forcing a drug addict into rehab, won’t work unless its of their own free will. At this point, shes just got him on life support."
"I've been in a similar relationship. Her partner will think this is 'the new normal'. I helped my current partner for 18 months & I told him I couldn't do it much longer if I didn't see him put any effort into helping himself. He's doing much better now! 

Don't put your partner on a pedestal, just because he did so much for her, doesn't mean he has a free pass to do nothing for himself. She needs to tell him that he needs to start helping himself or she can no longer support him, she's making it worse for him unintentionally."
"OP please listen to this. He helped you through, sure, and you did a lot yourself. You went to therapy, you worked on the issues, and you made the change to move in a different direction. That’s a ton of work and you showed up for the relationship by doing those things. 

He isn’t doing the same work. He’s not showing up. You are signing up to do this every day and not have time and energy for other pursuits. 

He needs to go to therapy and start the work. It is understandable at first if he didn’t, and he cannot keep staying in that rut, he will rot there. If your therapist allows, you could offer a couples session to get him started. You can continue to support him, just be aware that his helping you is not the same as you helping him. He was supporting you as you worked on yourself. You are supporting him as he continues to go deeper into depression."
"Yeah. It sounds like the bf and OP may have become codependent. 

When you're codependent, consciously or unconsciously, you slowly but surely stop having the self-motivation and confidence to be independent. In the bf's case, this means he loses any drive to actually pursue and put effort into self-improvement or even self-maintenance, and instead relies on OP for those things. In OP's case, this means you begin to feel overly responsible for the physical and mental wellbeing of your partner. Both of them are fighting to maintain that codependence because over time, they've become unable to define the love between them or even their own separate sense of self without it. 

The bf can't leave because without OP, he feels like he has nothing keeping his head above water, and OP has been supporting him for so long that he likely doesn't remember how to keep himself afloat. 

OP can't leave because they feel too responsible for their bf. They are aware that they are single-handedly what's keeping him afloat and can't bear the thought of leaving him to drown. It hasn't occurred to them that just treading water *for* him isn't the same as actually teaching him to do so himself. They are at this point directly contributing to the codependency and their partner's lack of self-drive to improve his own life and mental state. 

It's not a healthy or sustainable position for *either* party. If they go on as they are now, they'll just *both* end up underwater. The bf will cling to OP and OP will cling to him, both in an effort to keep just him afloat, until they *both* drag each other down. 

There is a difference between supporting someone and just straight-up carrying them. Supporting someone means letting them lean on you until they're able to walk on their own again. Completely carrying someone for long enough means that they will just forget how to walk on their own."
I left my ex because of this and he still hasn’t changed. But complains that he has
"Agree, you can't fix someone who doesn't want to get better. What will they do if something traumatic happens to her? Will he step up and take care of the the same way she has been doing for him? Somehow, I doubt it 😕"
Yup. As my therapist once said: “sometimes you just have to let him fail. He’s never going to learn if he never has to deal with the consequences of his actions.”
"Excellent insight.

You can’t save someone who doesn’t want to save themselves. 

OP, you must know this deep in your heart. You have your own issues (my list is very very similar to yours), and you know the importance of getting professional help, doing the work in therapy, taking the meds needed to keep you stable. 

If your bf was doing the work but not making progress, my advice would be different. But this man is showing you that he’s unwilling to do the work to be a functioning human. Why would he? You’re there! You’re doing everything! 

I know you love him, but love has its limits. Right now you need to love yourself and put yourself first. Is this how you want to live for the next year? The next 5 years? 10, 15, 20 years? 

You deserve more than this. Please talk to your therapist about why you’re accepting this behavior from your bf."
"Excellent taste in username btw, js"
The last post I needed advice on how to further help him. I refuse to believe that walking away is my only option. What kind of person leaves someone at their lowest?
"I like this comment bc she doesn’t want people to tell her to leave but that’s the realistic question. If no, you should leave. If you’re cool w being a caretaker, stay"
This comment gets it
"I am in therapy, and he’s not reciprocating constantly now because he’s not well but I had a good 3 years of him being the best partner anyone could imagine while I was struggling with my mental health"
She has a previous post of her having to look after her mother as a teenager. All this woman knows is caring for someone until she burns herself out. It’s really sad honestly
"This is exactly what it is. And it’s not so much that she enjoys it, it’s that it’s terrifying to think about him not needing her to coddle him. If he doesn’t need her to take care of him, then she’s worthless and he’ll leave her. So it’s better for her to keep him acting like a helpless child. 

Refused to get out of the car at a therapy appointment? Refusing to talk to a therapist on telemed? Is he fucking 4 years old??? 

Doesn’t help at all around the house? Wow what a shocking thing to hear, he’s so unique and different to the other partners out there who take advantage of their SOs. This is purposeful refusal to do anything to change his life. And why should he, she’ll do it all for him. And then someday she’ll wake up at 40 and realize she spent most of her life caring for other people who don’t give a shit about her."
"I don’t enjoy it. At all. I just don’t think that commitment and loyalty always have to be joyful. When we first met we were reversed, I was extremely depressed and his care and love gave me the strength to fight for myself. I’m just trying to return the favor."
I have Pure OCD so my standards for myself are high across the board constantly. He is our bread winner and pays most of our bills and gets a ride to work because I don’t have a car and he wants me to be able to get around during the day. He doesn’t “give me nothing” he just doesn’t give himself anything :(
She is being selfish harming him in the long run. She really needs to speak to her therapist about this because she seems totally blinded by her behaviour and how it is harming him
Or maybe she's just not a selfish person like everyone today
This
"I do. I told him I wanted to go back to school because I was drifting, so he paid for my tuition. My car broke down so he gave me his and found a ride to work. When I was with my abusive mother he held my hand while I called her out and got my sister removed from the home with CPS. When the time comes that I need him he is always there."
"My relationship isn’t “super special” I just think people forget what a relationship actually is. It’s not always perfect it’s not always easy and it’s not always fair. That’s what I mean. Love is action, not just a feeling. If you aren’t willing to give all you have to the person you love I don’t think it’s real love."
Yes AND he pays all of our bills :) lol
In what way am I relishing in this? Being willing to do something doesn’t mean in licking up every second and enjoying the situation. Like what the fuck
You’re soooooo right I just LOVE having to support the man I love while I watch him lose himself in sadness after I’ve already watched his father die and him almost actually die. It’s so fun and I enjoy every second!!
"My mental health is just fine at the moment, better than it’s been in a while. I’m on a new medication that seems to be working well for me. Why shouldn’t I be proud that I’m willing to give everything to the person I love instead of throwing things away when they get hard?"
"It isn’t hard at all, and nobody needs to be saved from him. He’s simply depressed after having a few traumatic events."
"P.S. Life and relationships can't always be 50-50. Sometimes it's 80-20, sometimes 60-40 or sometimes even 10-90. And it's okay for it to be like that sometime. And you must not punish your partner for feeling low. It simply will traumatize them into believing that they're disposable just because they aren't feeling good."
He’s worth everything
"I’m not hurting, the only thing that hurts is the idea that he doesn’t see himself like I do."
People are so selfish to claim to love someone and not be willing to be uncomfortable for any amount of time.
✨ depression ✨
The best things in life take hard work and the most rewarding things in life aren’t easy.
Yes. I’ve needed him before and he’s never let me down. Everything I’ve done he’s done for me it just has never lasted this long or felt this severe
This is something I was trying to explain but you have explained far better. I wish OP would listen but she’s got her fingers in her ears at this point
This is something I was trying to explain but you have explained far better. I wish OP would listen but she’s got her fingers in her ears at this point
This is what will likely happen because she is low associated with his depressive stage of his life. I hope not but the way OP is responding to comments and her edits make me think that this relationship is part of what is keeping them both down.. and he’ll realise that before she does
"That’s what I’m saying! I know him better than anyone. I know him. I know that I’m helping because I see the difference it makes… I don’t do his laundry because he’ll have dirty laundry, I do his laundry because I like the way he perks up a little when he’s able to walk into work smelling good, with confidence. I remind him to brush his teeth because.. ew.. and I notice that he’s more affectionate and smiles more when he’s clean. I don’t cook for him because he’ll starve, but because I know he’ll only eat junk that’ll exacerbate his medical issues, and I know he wakes up easier when he’s eaten all of the veggies he should. I care about him, I love him, and he works hard to provide for us. He has a savings account that he’s saving to buy me a car, he listens to intently to everything I say and keeps a note in his phone about every little thing about me he wants to remember, and when he’s dark in bed I’ll find him scrolling through an album on his phone of pictures of me. 

I KNOW he’s worth everything I do for him, because he knows I’m worth everything he’s doing for me. He just needs to bet on himself as much as he bets on me"
"So you 
A random person on the internet knows better than his and her family.
You’re advising her to isolate herself from anyone who tries to intervene.
This is dangerous advice and sadly the only advice she will listen to because it fits with her view.

Look at her post history of being forced into a carer role at a young age and how that impacted her, look at her language. “No one knows him like I do” “I think other people just don’t really love their partners”. 
It’s fine to give her hope and general advice but to tell her to cut off people who actually know her in real life and want to help her is really bad and dangerous advice"
You’re wrong :)
"I’ve put effort into trying to get him to get better, but unfortunately his family thinks that mental illness isn’t real and just an excuse, and that he just needs to pray and go to church to get the demon out 🙃 his mom heard that I go to therapy and thinks I’m a bad influence for trying to get him on medication and in therapy, so she doesn’t like our relationship. It’s not easy to get 24 years of conditioning out of someone"
“True off my chest”
"I’m not going anywhere. He’s working full time and paying for the majority of our bills. He tells me all the time he understand if I have to leave but that’s just so silly to me. He has a chronic illness and he’s depressed, that doesn’t make him lazy. He’s trying really hard to"
My bf almost died 2 years ago and then his dad died from the same chronic illness and now he’s extremely depressed and I try to help him day-to-day. He helped me for years before with my mental health so I don’t see anything wrong with helping him now but everyone is convinced I’m wasting my 20s.
"Most people with mental illness find pets give them a reason to get up in the morning and bring some joy into your life, and that’s true for us. While I do a lot of the basic care, he loves to spend time with them. We have 2 lizards and 2 cats, we feed them all appropriately- cats eat wet food only, they get lickmats with ground organ meat a couple times a week…they have 6 litter boxes and at least one piece of furniture for each of them in every room of the house along with about 10 water dishes scattered about including fountains. They see the vet twice a year minimum, they’re both fixed, they see the groomers every other month and get brushed nearly every day, because they love it. And boyfriend loves to play with them. They play fetch and he gets a kick out of it. 
the lizards can only be handled once or twice a week and only really require spot cleaning and humidity checks because they’re in bioactive enclosures and all of their heat/lights are on automatic timers- we also have 2 cameras in each enclosure and Bluetooth digital thermometers that notify us when they move around our if the temperature is fluctuating. They see the vet annually and have all of their vaccines, and they’re even fixed just to avoid any reproductive problems down the line."
"I wanted advice on how to help him but instead everyone just wanted me to leave him and said I was the reason he wasn’t doing well and that he’d be better off without me. I know that’s not true so I came here to talk about the fact that people have too shallow of a view of what love is, people expect everything to be easy and it’s just not"
"I don’t think he or our relationship is disposable :( just because it’s difficult for us right now with his mental health doesn’t mean that I should just abandon him at his lowest… he doesn’t deserve that, especially when he was abused by his father who told him he deserved it. I’d just be proving his father wrong- what kind of woman would do that? I couldn’t imagine hurting him in that way. Right now I can handle it, I am handling it, and I’m tired of people acting like he’s useless just because he’s sad. It breaks my heart people don’t see him like i do. Especially him."
You cross posted in multiple advice subreddits. You were hoping for validation (obvious from your defensiveness). You are not fooling anyone.
I am! We’re going to a paint and sip class this weekend :) and we go on walks every evening after dinner
How he reacts to OP leaving would only be his fault.
There is a fine line between helping and enabling.
"
OP, I’m a recovering alcoholic. (Bear with me - I promise it is relevant to your situation). 

My ex really loved me. And I loved him. And he thought that if he loved me enough and helped me enough, I would get better. He also believed if I loved him enough, I would get sober for him. 

The reality is that he enabled me. I had no reason to get sober cuz he was loving me no matter what, so why would I quit? Truth is, he was loving me to death. Literally. He meant well, but he was actually helping me slowly kill myself.

I tried to get sober a few times - for him, for my son, for my family. But the reality is, a person can’t change for someone else. They have to do it for themselves. Period.

It wasn’t til he finally left me and I had to take care of myself that I finally found the strength to get sober. Him leaving me was painful but it was the best thing that ever happened to me.

If you really love yourself AND your bf, you need to walk away. That doesn’t mean forever, but it does mean for right now til he gets better. 

You two sound very codependent. That’s sooo unhealthy.

Don’t light yourself on fire to keep him warm.

Good luck to you both."
Exactly. Build a man a fire and he's warm for a night. Light a man on fire and he is warm for the rest of his life.
But you damn sure can’t make ‘em drink
But it's considered bad form to hold their head under it til they drink.
"Excellently put. No notes.

I REALLY hope OP reads this, but something tells me that even if she did, she'd dismiss it out of hand...

Everyone's telling her, in regards to the bf, that you can't save someone that doesn't want to save themselves. Ironically, the same applies to OP (because of everything you outlined above). Until she recognizes what's actually happening and does something to remedy it, nothing will ever change."
Sorry. I shouldn't have been so absolute because there are definitely situations like that. The issue is still the same though: him.
Omg same!! He still won’t see a therapist or pay me back. He hasn’t worked on himself at all. But he says he has 🙄
"It’s not a binary choice. You don’t have to walk away or stay and make your entire life about caring for him.

You’re young. Your post history explains you were a caretaker far too young and now you’re in that position again. You know that childhood you’ll never get back?
You’ll never get this time back either.

Leaving may be the spark he needs to help himself.
If that’s not something you want to do, perhaps you can find way of helping him help himself more.

At the end of the day - you loved yourself enough and HIM enough to try and get better from your lowest. Currently he doesn’t love either of you enough to try.

I’ve experienced something similar to the both of you and has hard as it was, I believe what saved me was that I didn’t have a safety net. I literally had to get better or rot. I had to work to survive. I hope you can find a way to help him and you can both be happy together but if you carry on as you are, nothing will or can change."
You are not leaving him. You are allowing him to live HIS life. This is not your mental health journey. It is HIS. And you are forcing his stagnation babying him. He needs a wake up call and he needs drive neither of which he has with your saviour complex. Walk away. Keep in contact with his parents as they seem to care about him and you. This is not goodbye or the end. It is him needing time to face his problems instead of being enabled by you. You can always return to him once he improves in a year or so. You need to talk to your therapist about this your mindset is heavily flawed
"You claim to love him, but refuse to do the only thing that will actually help.  

Stop enabling him or admit you are doing this all for yourself and don't give a shit about him."
"What if he won't ever get any better? Then what? The problem is that you can't help people that don't want to help themselves. That's a hard lesson to learn. Are you willing to live like this for the rest of your life? At which point will you say ""enough""?"
"You can’t further help him, he has to help himself. Maybe giving him room to do so where he isn’t enabled to do nothing is the right answer."
"There are things to do before leaving. Have you talked to him about a therapist or medication? Is he doing anything to actively get away from his lowest? You can be there for him 110%, but only he can pull himself out.

I'll give you some examples. When my husband and I were first living together, he lost his job unexpectedly, and it was really difficult, especially because we were in the middle of the 2008 recession. He got discouraged and depressed, and I was there to listen. But I was also there to keep him applying, keep him moving. He did of course get a job, and everything got better because we worked on it together.

A few years ago, I had a literal mental breakdown, caused by a lot of different things. It was a slow decline of depression until I was actively suicidal. My husband listened to me, did extra housework, and made sure I was safe. But he also helped me find a good therapist through our insurance. He asked me to ask my doctor about increasing the dosage of my anti-depressants. He made sure that *I* kept moving this time. And again, things got better because, even though one of us was struggling hard, we *both* worked to get through it.

It's beautiful and wonderful that you want to care for your boyfriend so much. But you can't force him back to himself by loving the sadness out of him. He has to take some active steps too. Otherwise, it's just not fair to either of you."
"Just to give you some perspective, I was kinda in a similar state as your bf couple years ago. And I will say, my support walking away is actually what made me heal. I was able to take back responsibility and do what I needed to. I gained lots of confidence once I was done grieving the relationship. Best thing that happened to me."
"Someone who values their own life, and won’t waste their one chance of living by dragging someone along who won’t move themselves."
"You have to be willing to see past your opinion on the matter. When in reality the best advice is to walk away. And I’m suggesting to walk away for good. But honey, at this point you are doing nothing but enabling that behavior. Why on earth would he lift a finger to better the situation when he has you to basically wipe his ass for him? He’s gotten so low and so used to it that change will not come without sacrifice. You have to be that sacrifice to light a fire under him and force his hand. If you stay, so will the behaviors."
"I really understand where you are coming from and how much you’ve supported each other through. It’s not easy to find a partner who’ll support you that way and it has been mutual. I understand why you want to stay and hope for things to get better. 

He is obviously terrified and really needs some help dealing with that, but you can’t make him get help. Right now you’re understandably frustrated that he won’t seek help but I think you feel like it’s still early days. 

I guess the question is, how long can this continue before you begin to resent him for not doing all he can to get better? How many years of your life will you spend as his carer while he doesn’t try? That’s not a judgement, or for an answer at this point - just a genuine question to consider for yourself."
"Hey, look I've been here too. 
If you have a therapist, they have probably talked to you about denial as a trauma response. If not, follow this up."
I’m wondering if the family is telling her to leave because she is loving him to death. She seems to think sacrificing yourself is a virtue. It’s a little scary and what she is focusing on in comments is very telling.
"I don’t appreciate you saying I’m keeping him as a helpless child for my own benefit. It’s incredibly rude and entirely wrong. He didn’t need me to “coddle him” for almost 3 years before any of this happened and he still loved me. Even if I were to have been afraid of him leaving me because he didn’t “need” me, those fears would be long smashed by the fact he didn’t “need” me for a majority of our relationship. He needs me now. 

His abusive father once beat him for asking to go to therapy. He called him a “weak pu**y” His mom to this day pokes fun at me and has hidden my medication saying I just need a demon removed from my soul. His family doesn’t  and has never believed mental health to be an issue and he has listened to his parent berate and belittle people who go to a “shrink” and “admit defeat”. It’s going to take more than one or two attempts to get that kind of mindset out of a man. Especially considering his mother is still a huge part of our lives. 

Lastly, yeah, cleaning has fallen to the wayside for him at the moment. As it does for everyone at some point, and I’m not going to live in filth after having grown up in a hoarder’s house. And again, for the majority of our relationship, he’s always been on top of it, but right now he needs support. But thanks for assuming I’m wasting my life on someone who “doesn’t give a shit about me”. Good to know that years of being a dedicated, loyal, loving, giving partner means absolutely nothing. Whether that be the years he’d been those things for me before this or the time I’m trying to be those things now."
Well if he's not in therapy how is he actively getting better? Are you okay with his stagnation?
"Serious question… what happens when the tables turn in a month? Ten months? 

If you lose your job, get in a car wreck, etc. The window for him to heal, while you can fully support him, can be slammed shut at any time. 

I do NOT think you should leave him. I think you need a reality check that you are enabling him and doing more harm by allowing him to wallow at his bottom. You need to start helping him rise up from the dark. 

You remind him to brush his teeth? Fine. Remind him to get a therapist. Schedule him one and make him go. If he is so bad he won’t bathe, work with his family to get him into inpatient treatment. 

If he had two broken legs and could not walk, no one would blink about you helping him out. But if he had two broken legs and would not see a doctor to get them set and healed, that would be fucking insane… he would die, and you would be allowing it. 

That is what is happening. You are letting the man he was, die right in front of you. FIX THE PROBLEM."
"There’s the difference though, you fought for yourself, he isn’t. He won’t get better until he’s willing to put in the effort, and if it’s been two years of nothing, you have to start realising that he’s not going to. It wouldn’t be you giving up on him, he’s already given up on himself."
How long did he have to be your support in the beginning? Did he do everything you’re doing?
"You aren't returning the favour though - you're enabling him. He's got himself into a pit and what you are doing is making it so cosy and comfortable down there that he has no reason to ever even think of climbing out.

He needs professional help and to start the process of taking back responsibility for himself and his life, for both your sakes."
But you got help? You wanted to get better and did the right steps to do so. He isn’t. So the only way to like this current relationship is liking that he depends on you.
">fight for myself.

Is he fighting for himself?"
Well he mimicked your personality now . lol 😂
"Hey girl… you obviously have a strong heart given your situation so you probably don’t need this. But mad respect to you, for sticking to your morals and loving your person through the good and bad. If one day it’s not for you that’s your business but right now you said it what you want so f*** all them unsolicited opinions 🫶🏽"
"So he only provides material things for you. But I see nothing of emotional needs being met. He cares not for you if he’s not working on himself. 

True love doesn’t like being a burden to their other half. They WORK HARD and USE the help provided.

He doesn’t love you. It’s just a codependent relationship at this point, hun… I’m sorry it sucks to hear, but this many people can’t be wrong. Even his family and friends are giving you the same advice."
"Are you prepared for this to be your life forever? You do so much for him as many have said, you are enabling him. So why would he change? You have told him you want him to go to therapy but he knows if he refuses to go, you will stay. I wish you luck but It sounds like this will be your “normal” forever. 
Info: how can he work if he is this depressed? What does he do?
Edit: grammar"
"When did he do all this though?  
  
You spoke about these examples in your post as well, so like, okay, he did good stuff for you..but the question is, is he going to do that now....ever?

You've taken care of your abusive mother before, this is close territory. Disucss this with your therapist. And maybe when the whole world is telling you the same thing, give them some credit."
"The way you make it seem with the “you’ve been taking care of everything” like he wasn’t doing anything at all. Might want to edit this post. 

So just tell everyone to mind their god damn business. You and him are the only ones in this relationship."
Is he giving you all he’s got?…
"Your boyfriend isn’t willing to give it all he has, he won’t even take the first step to try & work on his depression. 

Even by your own logic you have a one sided relationship.  

The people closest to you want you to break up because they see how draining it is on you."
"Good then he should be able to figure out how therapy works. Your dynamic is unhealthy and will eventually lead to divorce. One day you will wake up and realize that you have been enabling him not helping him but you are so deep in it and so young you cannot see that right now.  His need for you is filling some void from your childhood trauma and I’d be willing to bet you basically raised yourself. But he’s adding to your trauma and is very toxic for you.

Frankly I don’t care if boy is paying all your bills I personally don’t believe in being financially dependent on others. Fine if you’re cool with that I’m just am not and it certainly doesn’t replace emotional and mental support or sharing in the mental load of running a household.

 I think you are falling into the mother fallacy but noting I or anyone else say will change that for you. That much is evident in the number of people who have already said this to you including his own family and you’re still on the internet trying to get a 500th opinion. You cannot save him AND it isn’t your responsibility to. Don’t let this boy drown you to save himself."
You’re literally pretending everyone in the world is wrong and you’re the only one who’s right and truly in love. You’re lying to yourself to make it seem like you’re doing something special and good. YOU’RE NOT. YOU’RE ENABLING YOUR PARTNER.
"You’re not listening to what they’re saying. Which is fine, its your thread. You did say that since you are doing all this, anyone who wouldnt doesnt love their partners. But youre not really helping him. He doesnt want to get better, and since youre doing everything for him, he can just keep doing nothing."
You should never need to sacrifice yourself for someone else. Why are you giving everything? What are you getting in return? This is a very unhealthy way to approach relationships. Have you told your therapist this? I would read to them this comment.
Op you're a sweet girl but in the long run you will be hurt. You're just holding on to his past self. You can't safe someone who doesn't want to be safe. And it's hard to hear that.. but AGAIN your life your choice. I wish you all the luck you will be needing that.
"I completely agree. Every person commenting here apparently sees relationships as being transactional and rational when it’s the complete opposite. I’m with my husband because I love him, not because of what he does or doesn’t do for me. Love isn’t rational. And I’m not gonna call it quits that easily. Yes it’s not exactly 50/50 but what things in life ever are? Relationships are work. Hard work. People are forgetting that. Period."
"Depression is an illness. Treat it. Medicate it, give it therapy, and let the patient do their work. 

After that, it's just a bullshit excuse like any other. 

I've been the depressed person, and I've had depressed family members. At some point, you're just aiding and abetting."
"There’s also strength in finding yourself and knowing when to walk away when you enable someone to not want to get treatment… You are not helping him, you are holding him back from getting better. You seem to think that if you stick with him and baby him like he did for you when you were depressed he will get better. Mental health is not linear. His mental health is not your battle and his battle is not the same as the one you went through. He needs a different approach. He has stagnated for years because he is comfortable with you doing everything forever. 

This is not a partner he is abusing your kindness even if he is unaware. His own family are telling you to leave him so he can focus on himself and you are refusing. You are being selfish. You claim you are in therapy and I highly recommend discussing this with them. Your drive to push your help and fight for someone who has done nothing in return is not healthy for either of you. You are harming his journey. He is not in a state to be in a relationship. Taking a break to work on yourself and for him to be pushed to work for himself is for the best. In a year you can check in on him and see if he has improved but honestly you need to accept that walking away is for the best for you and him. He has a family who obviously care enough about you and him to tell you to stop. Your constant refusal is not out of love it is out of selfishness."
"I love that OP.. you are so loyal and sweet and thoughtful. Whitcomb mine came around, and now, he. wants to do everything for me and our son. He is great & if i had left...i can't imagine my live without hiim. 


Proud of you. "
"I do not take time to read up on people's past posts usually. I specifically said my advise blah and how to do blah. Not isolate yourself or thay i know better than anyone. You on the other hand seems to me thinks to believe you know best? You skimmed my post obviously or simply do not understand setting boundaries? You could take another look. No harm. Bc i've certainly given no dangerous advise. 


Go on though. Seems like you're going to have more to say. Just do is both the service of reading my actual words. Bc you've misunderstoid @ very minimum. At maximum you don't comprehend well? Just let me know...."
"Ok boo

I hope I am"
Okay but why write a whole paragraph on how everything people will say will fall on deaf ears then??? If you actually didn’t want anyone to leave a comment or give feedback you’d write it somewhere where no one could do it. I think you know that you need advice/support which is why you wrote it here.
"Totally agree. I'm sure he has a stronger will than those that cast him down. 

Will is all you have sometimes. 

Sounds like he found himself a really great lady. 

Good wishes to you both."
Sounds like he’s even hinting that you should leave. So everyone including him thinks you should leave. But suuuuure babe you know better!!! It’s gonna work out great!
"Well, I guess that’s the problem. If he won’t accept help, sometimes the best thing to do is either give it time, which you’ve already done, and it’s clearly not helping, or leave and do some thing that’s better for you. You’re spending all of your time on him, and from how you describe it, it sounds unfair and unhealthy.

Don’t you think there’s a reason why all of your friends and family, and even his family, are telling you to leave? I know that you said you won’t listen to anyone, but I’m just saying as someone who has watched this happen multiple times, it’s not going to help anything. Taking care of him for a time makes sense, but at some point, he’s gotta accept help and try to help himself and he’s not doing that. That’s how my loved one was, and it ended up hurting all of us.  I already had mental health issues, but trying to help with him and trying to support those who were supporting him sent me into a deeper depression and exacerbated my anxiety. You said you have depression as well as other issues. Please please please try to take care of yourself, that’s all I ask. 

Like I said, I know you won’t listen to me if I tell you to leave. No one in my family listens to me when I try to tell them any of this. I just asked that you please take care of yourself and think of yourself. Love is hard, but it shouldn’t have to be this hard."
"Unfortunately today's society is extremely selfish, it no longer tells you to fight for the people you love but to think only and only about you, an extremely selfish society, the famous ""in good times and bad, in health and in sickness"" no longer counts nothing, moreover If the victim is a man, then he doesn't deserve any mercy. As I have already said, however, the fact that you do everything does not help your boyfriend, he must undergo therapy, take medications, he must find the strength to get back up, for this reason you must have a serious conversation and you must explain that you can no longer take on the burden of everything , he must understand how tired you are and how you are struggling in this relationship and he must fight personally, I also strongly recommend couples therapy, because you need a professional to open his eyes and can help you on how to progress step by step"
This post was not cross posted to any subreddits. I’m not seeking anything but to get something OFF MY CHEST per the subreddit this is posted in.
"And the advice I was seeking had nothing to do with wanting to leave him, or knowing if I should stay or not. It was advice on any other ways I could help him. I get it, everyone thinks I’m what’s wrong with him, that he’d be better off without me. Super cool. Idgaf, I’m not going anywhere. He won’t be left while he’s at his lowest so sorry everyone!"
That’s wonderful! Accomplishing stuff like painting is a huge boost in those feel-good feelings! I’ve been wanting to do stuff like that with my husband (he’s not always in his happy place and will sit in his dark hole every now and then). Maybe I’ll try to do that again. We too go on walks when we can and his mood has been improving.
"I don't know what you mean but I think you don't agree with me and you are saying that she should leave him...

Umm.... It's up to her ( she won't leave him I know ).... But I would really feel bad for the guy, if she left him.
I mean he saved her from her mother's abuse, paid all of her study fees, bought her everything he can, gave her car... Cared for her, treated her well when she had depression...

So now he is mentally not right, so she should stay with him right?

He loves her and she loves him, so why should she leave him...

Just asking ""Will you leave your lover if he/she gets some bad mental condition""
I don't know about you,
 I am sorry for being like a old guy but I won't ever leave them.

I really don't understand why people downvoted me?

I would be really greatful if you or anyone else could explain me the negetive behaviour of fellow humans towards my opinion ---- thanks."
"But it can be so hard to see that line when you love someone so much who’s supported you at your all time lows when NO ONE else was there, I get where OP is coming from. Is there anyway you can directly sit him down and let him know that you need him to meet you half way? I don’t think abandoning him is the right answer, but idk, maybe I can be a bit codependent? The way I’d look at it is I would feel like leaving him would be abandoning him and that’s not helpful, but being honest with him and let him know you need him to meet you halfway, OP."
This part
"This, OP. This is gold. 

You need to hear what she's trying to tell you because, if you don't, you will destroy both of you."
"Oof, that is so like my experience with my late partner, except I was the carer/enabler.  His addiction ended up killing him."
Thank you for sharing even though OP isn’t ready to hear this and apparently didn’t come here for advice according to the edit. Hopefully your story will reach someone who is ready.  Congratulations on your sobriety I know it isn’t easy.
"I hope op sees this, it’s perfect"
"This brought me to tears. It is so hard learning this.

I hope you are in a better place now (assuming because you said recovering). 

You are so right! You need to want to change for yourself, not others."
"I firmly believe that unconditional love is only healthy when it goes from parent to child. Yet we all think that’s the goal because that is the first love we’re offered (even if it’s not unconditional most parents won’t actually say it isn’t, which seems hella confusing.) l"
"My mom had to walk away from my dad in order for him to wake up and get sober. He's been sober for decades now. She did go back to him, but she realized that the only way for her to save us was to let the ship sink and put herself and us kids on the lifeboat. If he wanted to join us, he could. It took him a while, but he did it."
Preach sista.
Believe what you want I guess
"op said in another comment that they scheduled a therapy appointment and drove him there but he refused to go inside, and then they made an appointment with a telehealth person and he refused to talk to the therapist and was upset for days at op :/"
I have another comment basically saying just that. Her mindset is very flawed and I think it is obvious her help is not longer help but hindering any progress he makes because she makes him comfortable suffering. She has a therapist and obviously needs to sort through her own stuff. Her boyfriend also needs to sort himself out. A break to work on themselves would really be the best here for everyone
"No offense but you wouldn’t be aware of it if that’s what was happening. My husband and I have both been in this position and we dealt with it promptly. As in, we are both medicated now. You have to wonder why he isn’t and why you’re okay with him not taking care of it."
"I was in your position with my ex girlfriend. Four years of being a ""dedicated, loyal, loving, giving partner."" She broke up with me because she fell out of love with me. I strongly suspect it was because I was in the caretaker role rather than the equal partner role.

I was baffled how she could just throw away four years of endless financial and emotional support and free labor. But a situation like that creates a clear difference in roles. She contributed nothing, I contributed everything. And eventually she no longer saw me as a romantic interest because I was simply her caretaker."
"I’ve already scheduled a therapy appointment, took him to the building and he refused to walk in. Then I found one on telehealth and he refused to speak and was upset with me for days. I’m always talking to his friends and family and encouraging him to go out with them when they have something going on, to the point I’ve gone to see if he’d come and he still didn’t go. When I do laundry, I wash it all and ask him to hang up his half with me and he either does it or it sits in the hamper. When I make dinner, I ask his advice on seasonings and try to include him in the process. If I’m in the middle of unloading the dishwasher and he walks by I hand him something to put away. It’s not my fault he doesn’t fold his half, or walks away after I give him one dish to put away. I’m pushing and pushing and pushing him and I’m sorry but I truly don’t understand how it’s my fault he’s wallowing when all I’ve ever done is fight for him. I talked to the doctor he was seeing and followed her advice, and now the food I’m cooking has blended up veggies in the sauce for extra vitamin intake, I’m always dragging him outside with me on walks for vitamin D and exercise. I don’t know what more people are saying I could be doing for him, honestly."
"Everything and more. He washed my hair for me at one point. The first time I cried in front of him he called off of work for a week and drove me across our state to shower me with gifts and love and time away from the harmful situation. My mom was a hoarder and I was living with her so cleaning doesn’t take much out of me, but when I finally decided I needed to leave he moved me into his family home and bought me a sledgehammer to take to all of the piles of trash in my former home. This isn’t an always thing, this is a now, while he’s grieving and facing his own mortality thing."
"For the sake of anonymity, I won’t say, but it’s a job where he mostly just puts in his headphones and does his job without talking to anyone. Sometimes he’ll just call me and say “tell me about your day”. I catch him up on my day and then sometimes he just wants to listen to me go about my day while he works."
"I have been for the past year or so, but it wasn’t always like that."
"Right now, maybe not. But he’s the only reason I am well enough to fight for him, because he fought for me first."
"I’m saving for a car but make enough to leave if I wanted, he just insists on taking care of me in that way. Especially while I’m going back to school."
Yeah I’m totally super selfish for trying everything I can to take care of him. For sure. 👍
Your hope is in the right place
"Nope, it’s true off my chest, meaning I wanted to get something….. off my chest. I tried to warn people that all of their assumptions and advice would be ignored, they just didn’t listen. I wrote that paragraph because I’d already gotten a hundred messages and comments telling me what to do and telling me that I’m the bad guy here, so I wanted to try to see if people would actually read and stop trying to change my mind. Obviously it didn’t work"
"He doesn’t want me to leave, he’s just worried that I’m unhappy. Meanwhile, he’s coming to me with baby names and videos talking about different parenting styles and ways we “have to do things differently so our babies to have to deal with this to” 

But sure, my relationship will fail because he’s chronically ill and worried it’s too much for me."
You are going to end up so burnt out and resent him eventually. You are not living.
"I did not say she should leave him, neither in my response to you or my response to OP. Although him doing things for her doesn’t mean she is obligated in any way to stay in a relationship.

The biggest problem with what you said is the idea that if she leaves he may turn suicidal. He is the only one responsible for his actions, for choosing to do something about his depression or not as well as any behaviors he performs as a result of his mental health. 

Do not ever tell someone or imply that they are responsible for or would be at fault for another person’s choice to end their life. That is wildly incorrect and a very harmful message."
Did you read her edit? Apparently we’re all trying to steal her dumpster fire and hits hers and we can’t have it. No one could possibly understand their Romeo and Juliet love story as no one on planet earth has ever been in her shoes trying to heal someone who has no interest in being healed.
I am so sorry
"Awww thanks kind stranger. I’m sooo much better. Life doesn’t all of a sudden turn into rainbows and jolly otters when you get sober, BUT it does make dealing with the downfalls of life significantly easier."
There’s a lot of genuine advice here and you’re responding like this to only one poster? You need to reflect properly or stop posting asking for validation only and kidding yourself that other people don’t love their partners just because they won’t sit watch and help them rot
"You seem like you want to be validated in your opinion on the matter instead of actually wanting advice. You’re now upset that we don’t agree with you. Your family and his family are absolutely right in this. I think you somehow thought you’d come here and get validation for what you’re doing but at this point you’re doing absolutely nothing to help this man. If you love him like you say you do, then you’ll walk away and force his hand to make those changes. You staying, well let’s face it, will keep digging that hole for him. He doesn’t have to do anything to change because he has you to compensate for him. Stop."
It’s the truth and you’re being blind and foolish. He won’t get better because you are enabling him. And you’ll keep crying about how he’s not getting better until it weighs you down enough that you stop caring for yourself. Reality sucks sometimes. Being ignorant sucks more.
"Oof, not good. He's got to *want* to get better if he's ever going to. OP shouldn't set herself on fire to keep him warm."
"u/Pitiful_Test4545 this is real. You will (or may already have) become a caretaker or mother to him instead of lover. In the past two years, how has your love life changed? Obviously it will change after such a dramatic event, but how is it now? How many times does he reach out to 
initiate a hug? To initiate a kiss? To initiate sex? What *does* he ask of you? What are you able to ask of *him*? 

People who have told you “wake up” aren’t doing so to be mean or heartless. They see a woman who HAS cared, who HAS done it all, the problem is that it has gone on *too long*. Mental health issues are real. 100%. But they’re also our responsibility to address, which won’t happen magically."
"If you truly love him you need to stop enabling him.  Enabling is not support, it's literally the opposite.  You're actively hurting him by doing all that shit for him."
"You need to stop, because what you are doing isn't healthy for either of you. You're going to ruin your own relationship, because it's never going to be one if he won't step up. A relationship is one of partnership and caring, it can't be perpetually one sided.

You're a caregiver, and you'll burn out and resent the situation or him. 

You have to let him manage on his own terms and see where that gets him."
"He’s content with you enabling him. The fact that he doesn’t get help and you stay and continue you bend over backwards to take care of him are all you need to know about how he feels about you. If he really loved you the same way you loved him, he’d meet you halfway and feel terrible for running you ragged. Romantic love should *never* be unconditional. You’re not fixing anything by doing all of this, you’re making him worse. He’s not motivated to change because you are just allowing him to mistreat and take advantage of you (he is mistreating and taking advantage of you, by the way if you weren’t aware. Like *egregiously*). You have zero boundaries and he’s walking all over you. Tighten up and get a grip. It’s cool to love someone and take care of them when you’re also being poured into but the way you describe all you do for him absolutely reeks of desperation and low self worth. He’s literally using you and giving you nothing in return."
"So it's not just that he can't help himself, or doesn't have the ability to help himself. He is actively REFUSING to help himself. 

That is a new level of disdain, OP. Refusing to talk to you because you did all the hard work for him, and all he has to do is have a conversation? Refusing to say a word to the therapist because his girlfriend dared try to do the ONE THING that is most likely to make his life better?  
  
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. The question you need to ask yourself is: are you okay with this dynamic continuing indefinitely?

He seems to prefer to stew in his own misery. Sometimes, rock bottom is what it takes to get someone off their ass. In this case, rock bottom might be his wonderful girlfriend leaving him after having gone above and beyond to make getting help easy for him, and only having him refuse her every effort."
"You need to STOP doing shit for him and tell him 

- “he does his own laundry, or you wear dirty clothes” 
- “you go get groceries, or there will be no food”
- “you get out of bed, or you miss work” 

Start spending your evenings with family or friends. Leave him to fend for himself. 

Push the baby bird out of the fucking nest"
This comment makes it sound like you’re his mother…
"The thing is, if you don’t do EVERYTHING for him, he’d have no choice but to do it himself. Or at least to do SOMETHING for himself. This honestly isn’t helping him. 
 
From the outside it does look like you enjoy him being reliant on you, but I know you said it’s not that. So you’re just letting him destroy both of you instead. Why should he change when you’ve set it up so he doesn’t have to?  STOP ENABLING HIM."
This isn't a relationship.
"No one's saying to do more. Most are saying do less, or at least do differently.  What you are doing isn't working and we are all a bit perplexed you don't see it."
"Hey it's ok, don't let the comments wind you up, there is something admirable about what you are doing for your partner & I'm sure some people are projecting because there is some jealousy of how strong & seriously you're taking the relationship (which is not a knock on anyone, who wouldn't be jealous of a strong relationship & connection etc. that this appears to be??)

As blunt as the comments might be, the message is one you need to take a look at because, it isn't fair to you or the relationship, if he has to rely this heavily on you, because if it's not already, it will negatively affect the relationship to a point it can't come back from.

I'm sorry but it's been over 2 years, he can't expect someone to help him when he won't even help himself by talking to someone & by letting you behave like his parents and he's the toddler.

You need to sit down and have a very honest & direct conversation about how it is affecting the relationship & how it makes you feel like he doesn't care about you, or your efforts or the relationship."
"Hon, I don't know your story or your details so this may be a miss, but there's something SERIOUSLY fucked up with the relationship dynamic you're describing. And I think what alarms me the most is how you seem to think what's going on is somehow virtuous. That alone tells me you don't know what a healthy relationship looks like.

From what I've gathered, your bf ""saved"" you from a tough situation and then nursed you back to emotional health. Healthy people look for other healthy people to date. If he was willing to take on a project like you were at the time, that's either a savior complex or someone who thinks only another broken person will accept them. Either way, it's not healthy.

And now you ""saving"" him is all of the dysfunction in reverse. And since it's been 2 years without getting any better, my bet is you've stood in the way of his recovery with all of your ""help"". Why would he try to get better when being a wounded bird means you'll do everything? Life is hard. If I didn't care about my husband's wellbeing and he waited on me hand and foot for being ""broken"", I WOULD FUCKING STAY BROKEN.

You want to know what you can do for your bf? See a counselor. Not him, YOU."
Are you currently in therapy? What does your therapist say about this dynamic?
Thanks for the info. Are you willing to answer my first question? Are you prepared for your life to be like this forever?
He seems lovely
"So you just sat there while he waited on you hand & foot and magically you got better out of nowhere? 

No therapy? No medication? Nothing but him doing everything for you, no work on your side whatsoever? 

Stop being so naïve, you making excuses is just enabling him to do nothing about it. 

I’m not saying you have to breakup but if he refuses to help himself nothing will change, except you getting dragged into your own depression."
All due respect you’re focusing on the wrong part of what I said.
Oh wait so you’re basically using him as a meal ticket and transportation 🤔 hmmm interesting…
"The fact that is the point you take from my comment is very telling. You are not selfish for being supportive, you are selfish for enabling his behaviour further crippling him and being too dense to see it. You have a very strange perspective on relationships. You have had to care for your mother and now your boyfriend. I think you strongly need to discuss in therapy your fixation on never giving up on people even when it significantly burns you out and leaves you mentally drained. You cannot help anyone while burning yourself"
I don’t think you’re the bad guy and I’m sorry people are making it seem like you are. I truly hope that you and your bf can work things out but I think you need to remember that you need to be taken care of as well. I think people are mostly worried that you’ll burn yourself out and start resenting him or that you’re kind of enabling him. Love in the scenarios can only do so much after so long
"Oh that's what you mean.... Yeah.....
Sorry... I actually didn't mean it like that..... I just meant to say that leaving him won't make him better person.

Because few people commented that leaving him will make him a better person as he will start doing things for himself...

I just wanted to say that it may backfire...

Sorry I actually didn't mean to say that she would be at fault.... 
And thanks for telling me my mistake (⁠・⁠∀⁠・⁠)"
Thank you.  He was an amazing man but PTSD drove him to alcohol.  He had so much more to offer but he didn’t believe that.
" No. I didn’t come here for advice. I didn’t come for validation. I came to get something off of my chest. Instead, I have a bunch of people blaming me for everything and acting like I’m hurting my boyfriend when I know I’m not. At this point I don’t care what people think of my relationship based on five paragraphs summing up the darker parts of four years."
"OP needs to get over the very immature belief that that love, her love, proven through selfless service (/s) is a magic cure. If it hasn’t worked yet then the cure is not effective."
So “fix the problem” but when I do everything you said it’s making him worse?
"Whatever you say, I guess I’ll just go throw away 4 years of love and devotion because redditors decide that my relationship isn’t worth anything because my boyfriend is depressed."
"I am one of the people telling her NOT to leave him, but that what she is doing is causing more harm to HIM. He is not healing. He is not healthy. 

If she wants to be a full time caregiver, cool. But that is not what is best for HIM. He needs help. What she is doing is not helpful. You cannot enable a person like this and improve their life. She is hobbling him."
"I mean....codependent people do form close relationships--by definition--and it doesn't mean they're healthy. 

I know I haven't seen a single thing here that I would be jealous of, *yikes*."
"This is exactly right, she sees herself as a hero but he is not savable in this messed up dynamic. He needs to make some effort. And she REALLY needs therapy, this is a disaster."
He is <3
"How in the world is that what you got out of that. I’m supporting him, he’s supporting me how he can."
"I kicked my own mother out of my life for using me. I know how to draw boundaries when I need them, and I know where the limit is. I chose the things i do for him very carefully. Things like wearing clean clothes boosts confidence, eating good food boosts energy, and when I ask him to brush his teeth with me or shower with me, we have a sense of intimacy that not only keeps him hygienic, but allows him to be vulnerable with me. It’s not like I’m killing myself, these are all things I already did, I just do them a little more now to help him feel supported and loved. It’s no skin off my back, I just get sad that he can’t help himself right now :("
"It’s hard seeing someone go through that. All I can say is I wish I could give you a hug. I had to watch a friend go through this. He was never the same coming back from Iraq. I know it’s not the same as a partner, and PTSD is just so hard on everyone. I worry many have it from the pandemic."
"Oh if you only read your comments and everything to your therapist. It is obviously you came for advice (your cross posted in advice channels) and you are seeking validation (you are not reading what people are telling you with an open mind, you are closing up and getting defensive)."
"Nobody is “blaming you for everything.” People are however sharing their similar lived experiences. The outcome of all of them are similar: the individual with the problem had no impetus to get better until they lost their safety net. 
You are taking those same outcomes as some sort of personal insult because they are the exact opposite of what you insist on doing. 
Respectfully, I’d suggest looking at why you feel so defensive in response to the overwhelming anecdotal evidence that when the supporting partner left, the troubled partner forced themselves to seek help. 
I have had a major depressive disorder cycle. The act of showering, getting out of bed, eating was way too much and overwhelming. But there was still something inside me that compelled me to seek help and fight to get better. 
Not everyone has that. You did. Your bf does not. No matter how much you love him, love is not always a magic wand. There is that old phrase if you love someone set them free. 
What you’ve been doing hasn’t been working. I would encourage to sit quietly and reflect on why. Be brutally honest with yourself as you ponder why you doing absolutely everything hasn’t worked. And then be brutally honest with yourself about how long you can keep this up. And how you really feel about the fact that your bf has done nothing to help himself. 
I’m interested in what your therapist has said about this."
"Literally what is the point of posting here if you don’t want opinions? I don’t understand the purpose of this post. You put this out there, you’re going to get comments about it. Would have been easier to not post this at all. Idk what you expected."
"At this point how much of this is genuine depression and how much of it is weaponized incompetence?


You need to stop doing so much for him. I bet he gets mad when mommy 2.0 stops doing everything for him."
"Uh, what?  I didn't say to do anything except for ""stop enabling him"" as you're still doing that yes, it's making it worse. 

He needs to do shit for himself, frankly he'd be better off without you."
It's sounds like it's not just people on the internet but people in your life. People that know you both and are more informed than redditors.
"Not telling you to throw it away, just telling you to stop cooking for him, doing his laundry, and waking him up for work. If you stop doing that, he will have to step up. If you keep doing these tasks for him, he will never have the desire to do them himself."
">redditors decide that my relationship isn’t worth anything

No one said that."
"4 years of experience and learning things about yourself is not throwing it away if you break up. Also, in the grand scheme of things, 4 years is nothing. 

Please read the other stories. You may very well love him to death."
"I agree - writing a comment that comes at the issue in a different manner in which you wrote yours, doesn't mean I'm disagreeing with you"
"it's called compassion dude, everyone else is just throwing aggressive comments at her, nothing wrong with trying a different approach to get the same message across"
I’m nobodies hero
"You love and you know him the best. Just make sure whatever decision you take, you have to live with the consequences (good or bad but hopefully good) not some randos on the internet who downvote everything."
"“How in the world”

Same as how you don’t understand there’s no real love in this relationship. Only codependency. 

It’s ok. We all need character development. Some hurt more than others. It all depends on when you choose to snap out of it. I just hope it’s sooner rather than later, the regret that comes with a lot of years wasted is heavy."
I think you’re a wonderful/devoted girlfriend for doing all that you do. I’m just worried that you might lose yourself in all of this because of your love and devotion to him. Ive been in this position before where I thought I had a handle on things but then I look up and I’m in a deep hole. I hope your bf makes a swift and consistent recovery but I just hope you look out for yourself as well.  🤍
"This post is not cross posted anywhere. I had a post a few days ago looking for advice, this one was not. I am not seeking any validation."
Idk maybe the name of this sub is true off my chest and I wanted to get something off my chest? Just spitballing here
Right. If people you know and people you don’t know are all telling you the same thing…it might be time to listen.
"I don’t think it’s throwing away anything to break up, I think it’s a huge betrayal to let someone help you get better only to leave them the second they’re an “inconvenience”. THAT would be a waste of 4 years."
Yet you talk about sacrificing everything for him. You really need to talk to your therapist about this. This is super unhealthy.
You think from reading one post you can tell me that there’s no love in my relationship? You have no room to tell me that based on a couple of paragraphs summing up 4 years of a loving relationship.
Hun you are. It is obvious. You’re young and have a die for my partner attitude
"The big difference is... you were willing to change yourself and get better.  He isn't.  He's actively refusing to get better and perfectly happy to let you be his mommy, his servant, his organizer, his maid, etc. You're allowing him to remain in a situation where he can chose to not get better. He's taking advantage of your kindness. If he cared about you the way he claims, he'd put in the effort to get better, but he's not. 

Are you still seeing a therapist for yourself?  If not, you need to."
"I had the same mentality when I was younger: helped my ex escape an abusive step father and neglectful mother, a perverted grandfather, an abusive ex boyfriend, and there was ALWAYS some form of drama in her family. I was always willing to throw whatever I was doing down and help her family. 


And what do I get in return? She cuts me off and starts dating a 34 year old, married, deadbeat felon, who's wife and step children live a block over. The oldest step daughter is only two years younger than my ex.


*That* put things into perspective for me."

"""They've developed a plant-based protein formula that’s reportedly twice as effective as whey protein"", I highly doubt this is possible, but I am gonna ask for a source anyway."
If you look at their investor deck..it shows their protein/amino blend...is in the 300s of the digestion scale...I think like 15 cals and you need like 3.2 grams of it
"I know I was skeptical at first too. Quote from their website "" Promino™ and Rejuvenate™ utilize a patented formula from the University of Arkansas, led by Dr. Robert Wolfe and is the result of over USD $20 million in research over 23 years including extensive human clinical trials on muscle repair, recovery and muscle protein synthesis.""

Ill also link their most recent investor presentation if you care to dig deeper 

[https://drinkpromino.com/Promino\_InvestorPresentation.pdf](https://drinkpromino.com/Promino_InvestorPresentation.pdf)"
"""When you eat protein, your body must first break it down to extract the 9 essential amino acids needed to repair and grow new muscle fibers. When taken as a supplement in the proven, precise ratio these free aminos are instantly absorbed into the bloodstream, without the digestive delay of conventional protein sources."" Made sense to me, but I'm not a biologist. So, basically, this is not a vegan protein powders but vegan amino acid (all 9 in perfect ratio) powders, which is why they are better than whey proteins due to skipping the digestive delay."
How is this different than any other plant based BCAA supplement already on the market?
"I am not a biologist. But from the contexts, I would surmise that BCAA is either not one of the 9 protein amino acids, or that BCAA is a part of the 9 protein amino acids but not all 9. All I could gather from their brochure was that this is vegan 9 amino acid powders, not vegan protein powders (with or without BCAA)."
"Thanks for the reply. I'm not a biologist either, but I know from my time as a gym rat that most rely on BCAAs for muscle growth and recovery, and there are multiple established vegan options in the market already. But maybe like you said, this could be something more complete."
"https://www.ajinomoto.com/amino-acids/20-amino-acids

Apparently, according to Google, there are 20 amino acids. Complete protein's 9 amino acids are called Essential Amino Acids, and 3 of them are BCAAs, but we need the other 6 (9 total) for muscles."
"Personally, I think these are excellent questions.  I'm tired of watching things that compare anything to the standard American diet.  It's time we all agree the SAD is terrible and should be abandoned, for literally any other diet!  I would love to see comparisons of various ""good"" diets.  Large clinical trial of vegan high fat vs vegan low fat would be amazing.  For me, vegan keto has caused my IBS to virtually disappear, but I'm a sample size of one (though happens to be the one that matters most to me!).  How about small things like vegan vs veggan?  I'm definitely done with the comparisons to the SAD.  If you're not an ethical vegan, seeing a large study comparing the different ways of doing keto would be very cool."
Saturated fat raises LDL (bad) cholesterol. Coconut and palm oils are full of saturated fat.
Please stop keto ! Vegan yes but stop the keto! Especially coconut oils are really bad! No matter what anyone tells you. I am a dietitian (vegan) but sometimes eat fat free dairy. And my blood work is great! I have very low ldl cholesterol and triglycerides. My hdl is Great and my hb1ac is nice and low as I eat low carb but not Keto. I pair my carbs with a lot of Fiber and eat mostly vegetables with a source of protein.
"What I’ve been reading for years is that LDL itself isn’t bad; small LDL particles are bad. If saturated fat raises LDL but it’s the large kind, that shouldn’t be a problem.

Saying something is bad and therefore it causes problems isn’t specific enough and risks throwing the baby out with the bath water. Is LDL bad? We know for sure that LDL can be small and large. We know it serves a purpose in our body. It moves stuff around our body. When I go to Quest to get the CardioIQ lipid fractionation panel done, the results break the LDL into small, medium, large counts, plus the peak size, and all of those have dangerous high and low ranges. So Quest Labs, that does a ton of the blood tests for people in California at least, is aware that it’s more complicated than LDL is bad.

Besides that, there’s also tons of research saying that Lp(a) is actually the problem. Drugs are being trialed and readied for market right now to lower that. And without doing a specialized test, Lp(a) is indistinguishable from LDL. So is Lp(a) the problem and all of the tests done on LDL were affected by Lp(a) and not actually the LDL? Does saturated fat raise Lp(a)? Studies already show that it actually lowers it. Which, if we want to jump to conclusions making assumptions about Lp(a), means people with high Lp(a) should be eating saturated fat.

Even ignoring saturated fat, cardiologists tend to put people on statins, but statins can/do actually raise Lp(a). So what’s worse for me, someone with heart disease: saturated fat or the statin recommended to me?

…also, I didn’t ask about saturated fat. Some lean chicken breast without the skin or some small amount of salmon is relatively low in saturated fat comparatively, and can be consumed while still following guidelines suggesting less than 10% or even 7% of calories come from saturated fat."
"That’s a weird comment to make on r/veganketo

Also, I’m questioning the vegan part, not the keto, and you’re telling me I’m wrong and not addressing the why, which is what I was asking about. Why should I be vegan, if people live for a long time and without heart disease in Japan and with the Inuit? And where are the studies showing vegan performs better than whole foods plant forward keto? Or even just low carb, no processed, plant forward with hormone and naturally fed meat?

I’m on a statin. My HDL is finally in range (> 40) with fish oil supplementation. I’ve been doing vegan keto with some meat for awhile and my cholesterol numbers are fantastic. To the point that I’m worried they are too low.

Why is coconut oil so bad? From what I’ve been reading, saturated fat isn’t correlated with mortality. There are some studies that show some negative effects, but I can’t find them right now and those negative effects aren’t clogging the arteries. At least, not directly. Cholesterol and calcium clog the arteries but cholesterol in your body doesn’t. The type matters. Small, malfunctioning, oxidized LDL particles and inflammation clog the arteries. So every study that says that saturated fat raises cholesterol is ignoring the fact that the type of cholesterol matters. Most of them don’t mention that.

I’ve been having around 10% of my daily calories from saturated fat (coconut milk and nuts) daily for months and my cholesterol markers are all fantastic. In my individual case, I’m skeptical that coconut milk or saturated fat in moderation is a problem."
If you have heart disease you should be getting the opinion of a cardiologist and a dietician that works with them.
The replier may have not realised which sub they're on. I got this as a recommended post related to r/shittyrestrictionfood and I assume that the person above got recommended due to being on r/vegan or r/askvegans or something.
"One of the cardiologists I mentioned above? Joel Kahn, Dean Ornish or Caldwell Esselstyn? The ones who I don’t understand how they are ignoring Japan and the Inuit with their statements?

I’m following my cardiologist’s advice. I did the Dean Ornish program. I’m not saying they’re wrong or that everyone should go off all meds. I haven’t gone off any meds.

I’m looking for answers to my questions above so I can understand why I’m following my cardiologist’s advice. The questions seem pretty simple and should have pretty simple answers.

How does anyone know that vegan low fat is the best when they haven’t done trials comparing vegan to other diets? And how can they ignore the fact that in Japan and with the Inuit, where they have extremely low heart disease rates, they eat meat?"

"Well, it's only a matter of time before IT needs F(r)ED again..."
I welcome research funding but none of these will have a big impact. Don’t they know that thousands of us have already tested these.
"Pacing, strength training, melatonin and meds that keep you awake. What a joke!

"I take melatonin as one of a handful of supplements that I credit with allowing me to sleep through the night, but taking modafinil was an absolute disaster and left me a depressed, jittery, sleepless mess. I lost a lot of functioning on modafinil, and ultimately, finding a low level of exercise that existed within my moderate pacing needs, adding rest to my day, getting my hormones in order and taking famotidine, melatonin, and magnesium are the things that made rest possible again. Before that I would just be under a dark blanket trembling and hoping for the best.

Hope this helps some people and starts to document what we already know through having lived it."
Can someone explain what light therapy? Melatonin and what with the people who stratet to take antidepressiva for sleep since 2+ years? This shit is  also addictive and causes withdrawal even some permanent damage
It's downright harmful as it's taking away resources (researchers' time and money) from helpful research.
This isn't the moonshot money...
It is using different intensities of light to affect the circadian rhythm. These are different colors such as cool light in the mornings and warm light in the evenings.
Yeah I know. But this is the crap they’ll waste that on as well.
Pretty crap isn’t it?
"Dr. Nath suggested the following treatments recently after presenting their findings on ME/CFS & LC:

- Checkpoint Inhibitors
- Anti-CD20 
- Anti-CD19
- BTK inhibitors
- Mycophenylate
- Tacrolimus
- JAK/STAT inhibitors
- IL-1 blockers
- IL-6 antagonist
- IVIG
- Immunoadsorption

When he was asked by the audience when many of these trials would start, he said ""I don't make funding decisions, but these should happen"". 

I would encourage people to write to RECOVER to sincerely rethink these trials. They do not align with the current research nor their own special groups researching LC / ME/CFS. This is embarrassing to say the least. Especially compared to other groups like:

https://www.science.org/content/article/long-covid-trials-aim-clear-lingering-virus-help-patients-need"
"These are the suggestions of an agency that doesn't want to deal with this problem, won't review existing literature, and is hesitant to spend any money to solve it. Symptom management without understanding of root causes.

The only thing that has touched my symptoms in 4 years of suffering is Paxlovid. My hope is that more competent research programs will produce better results with antivirals, monoclonals, and immunotherapies."
"I’ve had three in-lab sleep studies in the four years since I was diagnosed with Long Covid. The director of my sleep lab says she’s never seen such an influx of new patients in all her decades working there. There has been an uptick of REM disorder diagnoses and she believes it’s due to Covid. People with REM disorders are 70% more likely to develop dementia than people without them. 

As part of my job, I regularly process death certificates and I’d estimate at least 80% of them list dementia as a cause of, or contributing factor to, death. 

I can’t believe so few people are concerned about this."
"For those who want to know what the studies will explore the effectiveness of without reading the full article: 

*Modafanil and melatonin for sleep disturbance*

*Cardiopulmonary rehab and basic exercise education for those experiencing exercise intolerance characterised by fatigue but DO NOT experience PEM (apparently they'll screen for PEM and exclude anyone thought to have it)*

*An intervention called 'structured pacing' to support those who experience PEM. Will not include any physical exercise*


I'm a bit disappointed they're not exploring some exciting drug to treat PEM, but I suppose nothing has enough of an evidence base as yet for them to take the gamble of focusing their efforts on... You'd think maybe LDN? Oh well, let's hope this structured pacing is better than, you know, the pacing we've all been doing for years lol. Got to start somewhere I suppose."
I have had covid for 4 years. The NIH recruited me for a study. Turns out I had covid TOO LONG and they wanted people with less than 18 month. SMH.
"I was part of RECOVER early on; the first red flag was when they offered me an MRI safe mask to replace the Aura they asked me to remove while in the room with the MRI and then never gave it to me; when I freaked out about it the tech was casually like ""well its not mandatory."" Tf? Why would I want a mask you've breathed all over? Then the second time I told them I was on a time constraint as I was working and I only had time to come, do the scan and leave, and they left me waiting over an hour and nearly refused to pay me. I had to raise hell. Both times I raised hell. The people running the study don't even believe that COVID exists themselves and if they do, they're ignoring it/not doing enough to ensure the safety of participants. 

Doing RECOVER for that short time showed me that environments in which research studies/exams take place are not as controlled as they would have you believe."
I can't find the article can anyone help
"This is important research and good news for those of us who are dealing with the sleep deprivation issue. Taking a handful of Melatonin and a Benadryl will guarantee a good night's sleep, and a drug hangover the next morning. It's one of the ""hangers on"" symptoms left over from a 5-year stint of long haul COVID-19. I consider myself somewhat recovered, but it's all one day at a time. Who knows what tomorrow will bring."

It's like they're doing the bare minimum to make it look like they're trying so they can keep funding...
"Yeah this is not really gonna help anyone.

People have tried all of these things, and sure they help to some extent, and validating that scientifically is not a bad thing. But beyond that it's really not gonna help understand LC and actually cure people."
wonder if the goal of the virus is to make everyone have dementia would be an easy way to slowly invade a country over 5-20 years lol... I for sure feel like I've gotten dumber since getting the pfizer vaccine and covid especially with recall I used to have amazing memory both short and long term now I struggle to remember things I did the same day or previous day all the days feel jumbled. It also feels like everyone else has gotten much much dumber as well I also feel like I hear people wheezing and short of breath in conversation these are fit people.... in all reality clots and microclots would for sure fuck up your brains functionality if a pipe is clogged or has holes leaking the flow of water will be disrupted aka our memories/recall/brain and body health
OMFG. Why can’t they build on existing research from even over 30 years ago (ME) and we might actually have a chance. In fact get all the biggies in one room (especially Ron Davis) and throw MONEY AT THEM N GET THIS SHIT SOLVED FFS. DO none of them have brains??!??

">It has to be on purpose

Tbf it's not like they have total free rein, there's parameters they'll need to work within and they'll need to be able to justify their decision to focus on any specific drug or intervention, so it's not like they could do anything too off the wall. The catch 22 there is it means things don't get researched as they don't have sufficient evidence base, but then as a result they never get a sufficient evidence base to justify researching them lol. So it's less than ideal for sure, but I'm not convinced it's deliberate institutional obstructionism (though that's not to say the NIH doesn't have form for deliberate institutional obstructionism when it comes to ME/CFS in particular, just that that's not necessarily what's at play here). 

I'm trying to stay optimistic about stuff 🫠"
"Yeah it's a bit unclear in the article, it says: *A trial to test two drugs (modafinil and solriamfetol) approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat people who have problems staying awake during the day, known as hypersomnia. These medications are well-known but have not been studied widely in people with long COVID*, and then goes on to talk about melatonin for LC insomnia, so maybe they'd look at the other two to treat fatigue?"
"Tried Modafinil, kept me up for 36hrs"
Yup
I think they meant it was a bioweapon.
Pacing and melatonin. We’ve doing this since the dark ages ffs. They clearly don’t want it solved.

"It highly depends on your budget. Many people can’t afford the cost of a second therapist on top of ketamine. Some people want their therapy sessions during a ketamine treatment, others want them in the days after a ketamine session because they are too woozy during the ketamine infusion itself. If the latter is true, don’t want a separate therapist for that, and should they specialize in KAP, or do you want your ketamine provider to also prove the therapist? There’s no right or wrong answer as far as we know right now in which is better scientifically, so what provider you go with will highly depend on what you want.

To me, it sounds like you want someone who will work with you during an actual infusion; provided by the same clinic as your ketamine. This will be very expensive and hard to find, but if you’re gonna find it anywhere, it’s definitely gonna be in california"
"Tricky to choose. I opted for spravato because I wanted to avoid anesthesiologists being the providers. I’d much rather have psych trained nurses administering my sessions for their experience and compassion. For IV ket, in my area, those locations are run by anesthesia professionals, & sadly, the goal is money, not care. And I have absolutely had amazing care at the Spravato clinic in my town."
"Very much agree, as a client (consumer), you have to decide what route you think would be most helpful for you. I can offer my experience with some different routes I’ve taken, if that’s helpful. 

I’ve done IM with no therapy,  IM and had therapy a half hour after,  IM and had therapy the next day.  I am now doing oral ketamine (200mg) with my therapist (so actual ketamine assisted therapy, KAT) which is a three hour therapy session. I also still get IM boosters. 

I’ve found the oral ketamine in office with my therapist to be the most powerful in terms of gaining new insight, perspectives, and growth. 

The IM boosters also serve a purpose, but it feels a lot more biological, in that it provides a relief from the depression and anxiety to a degree. I find I’m less locked into black and white thinking, my mind is more flexible (which makes sense with neuroplasticity). 

When I started with Ketamine it was just IM, no therapy, and it helped me regain the ability to care again. I got some of my motivation and desire back to work on the deeper things. Doing the low dose with my therapist, has made doing that work a lot easier I think.  It feels like I am able to let my guard down more, be more receptive to new concepts/perspectives, and those concepts tend to stick better. 

Basically you have to decide on what you think will work best for you, and then you can narrow down criteria. A therapist who is offering KAT should be able to share about their training and experience. Many will have taken part in ketamine treatments as part of their training (some training by a are a weekend, some are months long), have studied harm reduction in psychedelic medicine, and ideally work in a modality you resonate with.  

I always have to remind myself that I’m a consumer in the end. We get to ask questions to ensure we get the care we need, and a good provider will be able and happy to answer them… and even admit if they don’t have an answer. 

Last piece, if you go the therapeutic route, having a solid rapport and trust has been shown over and over to be the most important factor in a successful therapeutic relationship. It took a while for me to start doing the oral ketamine with my therapist, and I’m glad it did because there is a solid foundation to work with. 

Good luck!"
"Thanks for your reply. 

I don’t need therapy during the session but I do want someone trained as more than a trip sitter who can monitor me during the session. I expect that integration will take place a day or two after each infusion.

The costs I’ve been quoted so far top out at $32k for six sessions and all of the pre and post therapy (intake, prep, infusion, integration) but most are around $8-$10k. 

I’m fine with a therapist that’s separate. I’m finding a lot of that- it was suggested I look at Psychology Today for therapists who do this and several list KAT and say something like, “I work with XYZ Clinic to provide dosing, choice of type of Ketamine and medical prescreening.” There are of course psychiatrists who can prescribe but those individuals, at least as far as I’ve seen, don’t offer a lot of talk afterwards. 

My biggest fear is that I do this and I am worse off. I read “How to Change Your Mind” years ago and what Pollan said then still seems to ring true in the research and anecdotal evidence I’ve read. When you start off in a vulnerable place psychologically, the therapy you get around any psychedelic used as a treatment for a diagnosis like mine is fundamental to the process. And also tripping completely alone or worse, with someone who doesn’t know how to redirect or stop the session if it goes poorly is a bad idea for someone like me. 

That’s why I want to ask good questions in advance."
"Thanks for your reply. Your experience is valuable. 

Allowing existing therapy to work is vital. My current therapist just had “the talk” I dread with me, which is the “I’m not sure I can help you.” She feels that there is some part of me (in the IFS sense) resistant to the EMDR. This has happened to me a few times in the past when I’ve gone deep into hopelessness. I get it, if you see someone regularly declining you will admit at some point it’s not working. Conversely, as a patient, the low point is where that is hardest to hear because I already have deep worries that I am just broken and nothing will help. 

Ideally I want to choose whichever has the most potential to work for me and has the best guardrails against making my condition worse. To me that is at least having psychologically trained in session with me even if it’s just to observe that I don’t go wrong.

Edit: I agree hugely with the consumer points you made. I have been a caregiver/medical advocate for several relatives and the choice of medical providers has literally been the difference between life and death. 

I feel the same about choosing this practitioner, I just don’t feel like I know how to discern well so I want to ask those with more experience what questions I should ask. If this was a physical ailment I have more than enough experience. But in that case you have time to evaluate a treatment as it goes along. 

This is a little more like a cancer treatment plan. (Having been thorough that a few times with family) You have to choose the best you can and go with it, often from providers who have substantive differences in the way they think you need to be treated. Time matters. In some sense you can’t go back. You may get a chance to redirect but you may be worse before you’re better. Obviously cancer’s stakes are different and there are points of no return with them more than this. But it feels like a similar requirement of the choice up front being the most important."
"I definitely understand where you are at. I had a very similar talk with my therapist, and that is what ended up pushing me to connect with a KAT trained person. It didn’t feel great at the time, but I’m so grateful for the push because my new therapist has a solid fit and really helped me grow. 

There are kind of two models when it comes to KAT (generally speaking). Practices that have everything in house (so psychiatrists, therapists… even in these settings if the psychiatrist offers talk therapy it’s often way more expensive then seeing a therapist in the same place), and therapists who partner with an outside psychiatrist to offer KAT. 

Most therapists that do KAT will have partnered with a local psychiatrist, who will complete an intake with you and prescribe the medication. I had to pay the psychiatrist for my eval but my therapist took $50 bucks a week off her bill so that in the end it was covered.  The cost for the medication isn’t absurd, I get ten 200mg troches for $71 (shipping with ice pack included). Different therapists might have other arrangements if they are working in house with a psychiatrist for example, but it’s more common to see them partnered with someone outside their own practice. Don’t let that scare you off. 

If there isn’t a doctor on site for your KAT, the medication will be sent to your house, and generally you sign an agreement stating that they are prescribed to be utilized with your therapist. You bring your meds to the therapy session, and at no point will your therapist touch them (out of their scope of practice). My therapist monitors my BP and heart rate at the beginning and end. Generally ketamine is a pretty safe medication, and the initial evaluation with the psychiatrist will help ensure it’s a good fit for you. 

I get your concern about set and setting, and the worry it could make things worse.  I’ve had some real big upsets during my treatment, including losing two friends in a month. I was really worried my IM would be a disaster but it ended up being really helpful. Lots of tears and grief, normal emotions to have, and then I had therapy after which really helped me process things. 

It sounds like you know you want to be doing the medication with a therapist, some questions I would ask: 
What kind of training have you had in KAT? 
Have you experienced the medications effects yourself? 
When was your last training? 
How long have you been practicing KAT?
Do you have a good relationship with the prescriber(psychiatrist), do you collaborate well together? 
What does an average session look like?
What do you do if someone panics? 
How do you reduce harm in your practice, and help ensure safety? 
What modalities are you trained in (IFS, CBT etc), and which do you find most valuable while doing KAT? 

A lot of KAT therapists will have done some studying/training with MAPS or be associated with APPA. You can ask if they are familiar with either. 

Finding the right practitioner is really important, it’s great you are digging into things so that you can find the best fit for your needs. If you want to chat or have other questions feel free to send me a message or respond here.  I kind of stumbled my way into great care honestly,  so there was some luck going but I’ve also learned a lot these past 8 months or so."
"Thank you very much. Those questions you wrote out along with your experience was really helpful. 

Unfortunately it's not the first time I've been passed off by a therapist. I intellectually understand the reasoning and the ethical requirement to do this but, in my state, hearing this only feeds my fears that I am beyond help."
"It’s hard to have hope when everything is incredibly dark, and I still very clearly remember feeling like I was beyond help. I told my partner in September I would try, one more time, just once more… I started the IM ketamine in October, no therapy. That helped get me to a place where I was able to have a some hope, desperately needed hope. I finally started with a new therapist in December I think it was. Don’t overthink this too hard for now, try some infusions at a solid clinic, and give yourself another chance. 

It’s so hard to navigate mental health care when you feel like utter crap and have zero hope things will ever really get better. It can though, it isn’t easy but you aren’t beyond help. Just posting here to see what options you might have and how to navigate them is a huge thing to do! Cling to the little ember of hope that got you to post and the curiosity that maybe, just maybe, you aren’t beyond help."
"Oof, I did not realize how far out in the tall grass this sub would be. Gonna have to unsubscribe. Good luck out there."
"lol this has to be parody right?    shut down for crimes against humanity? LOLZ

yes let's shut down every hospital and drug company, i'm sure when you get a heart attack or chop off a finger you will run to Joe Rogan for help and not a real doctor"
"Every life is precious and endangering the well being of citizens for the efficacity of an experimental drug is the complete opposite of what Medicine is all about.

Pfizer and Moderna have racked billions of dollars In sales and stock profits by literally experimenting with people. The life of this young man is worth more than all of Pfizer market capitalization. The fact that no one  cared to even mention the kid that just “ died”  in the article says everything that needs to be said about many people psychy.

A young man just died!!!!! 


Nothing political in my stance.

I am serious about what I do and the stance that I take. 
No corporations gets the benefit of the doubt no matter the “ good intentions.”

Secondly, I do not sell any product nor ask for payment, nor advise anyone to buy or sell shares.

I am creating a platform that can challenge the accepted narrative and enable open debates as long as it is respectful and structured.

This is not a cult. You are welcome to disagree with my takes as long as you can lay down some arguments. 

Thank you for your understanding."
Fuckin’ seriously. This post reeks of “anti-vaxx” bullshit.
"Ya I have to agree, some useful posts here but yikes. Unsubscribing as well."
is the person who posted this the guy we are supposed to trust with our money?  he seems like a scammer himself if this is how delusional he is.
"I'm out, sad this thing had potential.   the OP reeks of a scammer himself now"
"You are aware the life expectancy of someone with DMD is like 30 max, right? The kid was very sick to start with which is why you sign up for a clinical trial. You accept the risk of potential death. It sucks but isn’t super uncommon in clinical trials, especially for treatments for fatal diseases as it is."
"You may be right, but I still consider it unethical to experiment with new drugs on people, especially MRNA drugs that have clearly demonstrated their limitations in recent years. People close to me are still experiencing the after-effects of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. I simply don't trust Pfizer or Moderna."
Totally within your rights to not trust something. Do you’re own research. But how do you expect us to progress our knowledge of medicine and treatments of diseases without testing them beforehand? Would you prefer there to just be no medicines?
"mRNA have consistently failed since the 80s and were forbidden until…Covid came along and Pfizer literally “ bribed” Fauci with millions of $$$$. 

It is a money hustle. 

Look at all the commercials on TV. Most of them are pharma.

In most advanced countries in Europe, pharmaceuticals are not allowed to be commercialized. 

The biotech lobby is bigger than the oil lobby in the USA meanwhile we are the most obese, sickly, and drugged people on earth.

These people keep us sick for profit. 

Once again; not a conspiracy but simple evidence. 

The last 4 years really opened my eyes."

Not answering my question at all. I asked how do you propose that we create and develop medicines since you said you were against testing them on humans.
" I don’t claim to have all the answers on the issue but clearly, Nutrition causes 90% of our health problems. 
Ultra processed food, added sugar, high carb, chemically enhanced feeds and all sorts of assortments is the main problem. Drugs are a mere patch. 

You want to fix the problem you deal with the root cause. Which means that the biotech food industrial complex would have to crater like a sand pyramid.

Personal experience here: 

I have lost 30lbs on intermittent fasting low
Carb diet in 1 year. And I was somewhat fit not even obese .
I used to get headaches, cold, mood swings, and I was a sugar addict.

All
Gone within a few months. 

No drugs, no pills. 

For the special cases drug might help. But drugs and pills are not the solution for an endemic issue…"
"Again not answering the question. No shit losing weight is a good thing. And I’m not disagreeing with your stance on processed foods. General health started to decline once we started putting everything in plastic bc of the war.

I’m asking you how do you propose we develop medicines if we can’t test them on humans? That was what your big issue was with. Vaccines are a wonderful thing and have saved millions of lives thru time. I’m not saying there may not be issues with new tech but I’m saying there is a method to the madness."
"Vaccines are a good thing. The vaccine “ INDUSTRIAL complex “ is not. 

The Agro/biotech corps have a bigger lobby than even the military and oil. 

The whole healthcare system is bought out by big pharma and the results speak for themselves. 

When is the last groundbreaking vaccine to date btw? 

Probably a century ago!"
This conversation is pointless if you won’t answer the question. Quit moving the goal posts here. You know your argument is baseless. Move along. Have a good day.
"Dr Peter Mccollough. I listen to people way smarter than me and I do not try to win pointless argument based on faulty logic. 

Big pharma is it for profiteering not curing. 
The last vaccine breakthrough was about a century ago. 


https://x.com/vigilantfox/status/1788620916680704386?s=46&t=QmHdRqIcDBP12PQJkB4xfg"
"I’m sorry but wtf are you not understanding? I clearly, about 5 times now, have asked about your comment on not testing medicines on humans. I asked how you propose how we develop and test new medications then if not on humans. If you can’t answer this, this again, everything else you have posted is complete and utterly useless."
"Bro are you 5 year old or what?

The world isn’t black and white and there is a certain degree of ambivalence that must be taken into consideration. But to systematically use humans are guinea pigs for corporate profit is insane and sickening when 90% of the vaccines are useless at best and the society just gets sicker. 

If you can’t get that and want to absolutely win “ the argument”, please have it your way. 

That’s enough for me!"
"It’s not about winning an argument. I said previously I agreed with you about the monetization of it being wrong. I asked you how you propose we create medicines after you said you believed testing on humans isn’t right. So how would we? And 90% is quite possibly the dumbest shit I’ve read on Reddit in a long, long time. You can’t say you are about helping people stay healthy but not testing on humans to further develop the science of medicine. Do you realize how fucking stupid that is? Do you mean to tell me you’d rather take a drug or vaccine that has only been tested in mice? Or not tested at all? You realize how insane that is, right? I mean for fuck sake they shut down studies ALL THE TIME when there are bad side effects. People don’t realize how regulated pharmaceuticals is until you work for them. You don’t dot an “I” or cross a “T” somewhere in your work, it can cost the company millions. Everyone should have a right to take or refuse anything but to say testing on people is wrong is just fucking stupid. There is literally no alternative. It’s that or let the common cold or flu start killing people and kids and let natural selection take control. Let’s get small pox going again while we are at it since vaccines only work 10% of the time. What a fucking moronic thing to say."
"Bro, cut the crap. 

You do realize that what you call “ drugs” is simply natural herbal medicine that you can purchase at a Pennie compared to the mark-ups sold to you by big pharma. There is very little concern with “ health” and “care” in the pharma world. 

Once again you display a serious lack of deep thinking. 

Only a fool will absolutely refute the need for human subjects in some experiments. And, unlike you, I do not speak in absolutes.

But to make it a business model and to lobby governments like Pfizer and Moderna have done is beyond criminality.

The corruption is systemic in the healthcare industry. It is a cartel arrangement and the quality of the service it provides speaks for itself. 
With the trillions of $$$ spent on healthcare in the US, why do you explain the disparity between USA citizens rates of obesity, drug abuses, and others ailments with most advanced societies that do not spent nearly as much as us?

That’s the core issue I am trying to raise here brother. Not some bullshit back and forth about human experiments. 

Where does all that money go if people are getting sicker and sicker, fatter and fatter and families getting bankrupted because they can’t afford their medical bills and have to travel to Mexico for surgery. 

Since you are a 5 years old, let me state it clearly for you: 

Indeed we do need some experimenting. But the last vaccine breakthrough was 100 years ago! 

What does that say about the trillion dollars drugs:vaccine industry? 

It is a scam. Like the financial industry. The military industrial complex. The big agricultural industrial complex. The oil cartel…etc

And I am a Libertarian btw. Cartels do more harm that plain old socialism. At least in socialism we all get the same crappy quality of services and goods. 

With that said. I am done arguing with you. 

If dr Peter Mccollough can’t convince you on the criminality of the vaccine industry, especially with the Covid 19 hysteria scam, then little old me can’t and I won’t try to force feed it to you."
"Saying I lack deep thinking while you reply like this is fucking comical. We are about 8 replies deep and you still can’t answer the question I originally asked you lol what a fucking clown. The more I read from you the more I understand you just don’t grasp the concept of how things work. Ignorance is bliss I guess. I’m done. Enjoy your day. Glad to know the small pox vaccine was growing on a vine somewhere lol ffs “I do not speak in absolutes” lol you don’t speak anything coherently my dude.

The COVID shit was fucked the min it was made political and a requirement in some places. I’m against that but at the same time, something has to be done to protect people when they aren’t smart enough to protect themselves. Hell people bitched about wearing a mask and that was more effective and preventing spread than just about anything. But that’s another debate.

We agree on lots of subjects. The basis of most of the problems in today’s society is corporate greed and profit margins. It’s not just pharmaceuticals, it’s everywhere. 

BUT AGAIN THAT WAS NOT THE POINT OF THIS DISCUSSION. You seem to be missing that. It started with your first comment on human testing. I simply asked how your proposed to move medicines forward without them. We don’t live in a perfect world where medicines aren’t a need. Do you say just let people get sick and if you make it, you got lucky? Or what? Tell me how you see it. And seriously, if you can’t answer that, then stfu and move along bc we are achieving nothing by talking about COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS. 

Either answer the question and stay on topic or go away.

Edit to add: the last vaccine breakthrough was over 100 years ago???? Are you that fucking stupid? Educate yourself bro. Hell hepatitis B got licensed in 1981. You crumble your own argument the more you speak lol"
"Brother,

You are probably too smart for me. Want to argue with equal intellect? Why don’t you argue your case against the likes of Dr Peter McCullough? And Dr John Campbell? 

You buy your drugs and trust big pharma. Meanwhile, I eat my greens and take my herbal supplements."
"Btw, did you let these people stick that Covid 19 vaccine needle in you? I didn’t and I am doing just fine. I thought we were all supposed to die if we didn’t."
"Nobody said I trust big pharma. I just don’t think it’s a conspiracy like yourself. I work in medicine development. It’s extremely hard to create something that’s a wonder drug. It’s why every single pamphlet for a medicine tells you it’s prescribed bc the benefits outweigh the side effects. So you take herbal supplements? You know those are processed as well, correct? lol a bit hypocritical eh? Lol"
"I did get mine and I’m doing just fine. See, for someone that doesn’t speak in absolutes (your words, not mine), you sure are implying the vaccine was an “absolute” (don’t get it and die). I mean you can’t be that ignorant or much of a hypocrite can you? I mean hell dude not a single person said if you didn’t get it to at you’d die. Not one. Ignorant people took “increased chance” to mean certain death. Only a moron would think that. Again, it was doomed from the start bc it was made political. You think masks are insane and don’t work either don’t ya lol or is that another century old breakthrough too lol. 

Truth be told I had family members get it and not. One passed away. One got long Covid that triggered Alzheimer’s. One almost died in the hospital from it. There is no rhyme or reason to getting it or how it effects you. The vaccine was merely a necessity at the time since it was something that was extremely contagious that had no know treatments at the time. Had we a treatment and it wasn’t killing people at such a high rate, the vaccine would be treated like the flu vaccine: optional and recommended for high risk people."
"There are no magic pills and things are complex. I am not conspiratorial by any means. 
Just because you work in the industry doesn’t mean much. You are just a professional, not one of the guy pushing the policies. That what lobbying is all about. 

Supplements, herbs, nutritions, even some “ drugs” are necessary. 

My “beef” is the cartel arrangements in our various industries. That actually harm innovation as you stated yourself. The complexity of the regulations is designed to prevent innovation and keep smaller players from toppling the big corps. 

If the horse buggy manufacturers of the 19th century had as much pull in congress as today’s big corps, we might still be riding on horse carriages, and, dead horse cleaning may still be a viable industry minting millionnaires. 

I am not against innovation. I am against “ capture” via cartels and lobbying. 

The same thing is evident in the financial sector, oil, agriculture, media, military, even in sports. 

Ok that’s my last!"
"They threatened people. I know many people who lost their jobs for refusing to get vaccinated. The whole thing was a manufactured hysteria from which we are still trying to exit out of. 

Don’t be a hypocrite on this one!"
"You keep saying this over and over, and I’ve agreed with you. The greed aspect is terrible. I could tell you numbers that would make you feel even worse lol. 

Can you answer my question about why you think human testing is bad and how you propose we avoid it?"
"Who is a hypocrite? I clearly said I was against forcing people to get it and that making it political was horrible. It wasn’t manufactured hysteria though. What happened was real. And bc people wouldn’t wear and mask and use common sense, millions of people died that shouldn’t have. There does come a time when the government has to step in and help people get out of their own way. Should driving while being drunk not be illegal? It’s the same concept."

"That is a link to a post you made two hours ago, along with quoted text from... I don't know, maybe the automod? If I had to guess I'd say that different messages from the automod and in the rules post were updated at different times and haven't all been synched up with each other properly - for example, in that quoted text they suggest reposting every two weeks, but every time I've seen the mods come down on somebody for posting too often they suggest once a week.

"Cool, I was just thinking it's good to make an edit on the rules about how not to listen to the auto-mod so it's clearer that all caps are not good to have on the thread. Thanks!"
"It’s better not to have all caps on the internet at all. This isn’t a Reddit only thing. 

I know it seems strange to think that screenreaders work this way - I double check it every few months because I just can’t quite believe it myself! But it does seem to be the case that this is how they’re designed, and there may be good reasons for that. Even without the screen reader issue, though, there would still be the fact that text in all caps presents a small but real difficulty in reading for people with trouble distinguishing between similar letters - for example, people with dyslexia or certain vision problems.

As for your comment about ignoring the auto mod I think you know perfectly well that I didn’t say anything of the sort. The auto mod message does not say that you must use all caps, it simply has that text written in all caps, most likely in a misguided attempt to draw attention to it.

I'll delete my comments if that will help, but I mean it genuinely when I say I don't know if that will be helpful or not. I would like your opinion on it. Thanks!"
"Well, I'm sorry I misjudged you :)

I just take accessibility seriously. Of course, I do know lots of people don't know that about all caps, and I wouldn't expect them to if it's never come up in their lives before."
"Thank you for the apology, I appreciate the sincerity and the good faith. Accessibility is so important, it's actually really great to bring it to people's attention! I know I'll keep it in mind now, I just was confused by the auto-mod message. In an effort to show my own good faith (though I hate to be a broken record), would it be more helpful and appropriate to delete my comments along this thread? :)"
"Nah, but we really should stop pestering the OP. If we have anything important to talk about we can PM - but, uh, although I make that offer honestly I actually hate PMs, they trigger a huge anxiety response, I do not know why, so please, only if it really is important, not just to say ""Got it, thanks!"" or the like."
The possible implications for transplant recipients are ... horrifying.
Too bad doctors don’t believe in long covid
"Great, another way for use to be screwed!"
"From the headline I thought this article was going to be about the impact of COVID on surgeons and their ability to their jobs.


Love the recommendation to go to a LC clinic before surgery as if doctors know what to do to “cure” LC ☹️"
"Every article like this is just like "":("" and then we keep infecting every person 3x a year with no treatment or real vaccine in sight."
While they're in there cutting and slicing is a perfect time to get some tests for the live virus in various tissues.
Not good. I hope we can hear more of further studies.
At least SOMEONE believes in long Covid clinics. I just wish it was the patients.
fascinating
[removed]
[removed]
especially when hospitals don’t have mask protocols
I believe that people have already gotten infected organs and some have died.  It's a nightmare. We're living a nightmare
Not least because they have to take immunosuppressing drugs.
Bro you can’t link to a study done before covid existed to prove your point about covid. Covid is still relatively new in terms of how much is known as it’s still being researched but it’s pretty rash behavior to just label it as acting in the exact same way as other viruses
"Why? Covid isn't seasonal, it's always present. There are zero signs that people are getting it less and developing meaningful immunity to reinfection. Covid is more contagious than influenza. You are engaging in wishful thinking."
Can you provide a source for any of these claims?
tell that to my friend whose life has been destroyed by long covid
"Adults on average get influenza once a decade. Adults get covid twice a year. Even if the risk was the same, do the math. "
Covid is a chronic infection.  F off with your misinformation.
"It doesn't have to be new to be a serious problem.  Because practically everyone has gotten covid, and will continue getting it over and over again very frequently (1-2 times per year), there's overwhelmingly more post-viral covid than post-viral anything else.  

A small percentage of an enormously large number is still a large number."
Or screening protocols. Can you imagine getting long Covid because you needed an organ transplant?
"I meant in terms of viral reservoirs.  If millions of people now have virus-laden organs, either they need to be screened for it and the donor pool for *everything* has shrunk dramatically, or failing to screen them now carries even greater risk for recipients."
This reminds me so much of the early HIV/AIDS epidemic and blood transfusions.
"Right, so it's a double whammy.  Not only are they now significantly immunocompromised for life, they may have SARS-CoV-2 lurking in their newly-installed organ."
"Yes, I have lost everything myself due to this, and suffer all day and night. It's so painful I can only sleep 2-3 hours at a time."
[removed]
The parallels are terrifying
it would probably be best to avoid having viruses establish reservoirs in people's bodies. hiv has been managed well. perhaps we need to do the same for sars-cov-2.
It is not the same as from those other illnesses. You know little of what you are speaking about.

someone high up at nih verified that they had found evidence of a reservoir in an interview last week.
"My tumor was similar (T4N2, about 4cm, the margin of what they removed just crossed midline though the tumor didn’t). I elected not to join a neoadjuvant trial and went right to surgery. A big part of why is that they said they would not reduce how much tongue they took, with the trial I was looking at (which was immuno/chemo or dual immuno, not RT) and my tumor was really fast-growing and had a big extra growth that was filling up my mouth. I could barely eat before surgery; I’d been on a liquid diet for 6 weeks and even that was becoming impossible. 

My surgery was in June 2023. As for how I’m doing, no recurrence yet in the mouth but I have mets to lungs that are so far responding to immune therapy (pembrolizumab+cetuximab) but it’s early days. Other than that I am dealing with a pile of side effects—I have a PEG because I lost my swallow to surgery. It came back (work in progress) but I’ve had other messy side effects that slowed me down (a fistula and now a broken jaw due to osteoradionecrosis)."
"I’m very sorry y’all are going through this. I was T2N2M0 and HPV negative; I believe my tumor was 2cm; originally they thought it would only require about 1/4th tongue removal, but it ended up being poorly differentiated/bigger than they originally thought, and they took a little over half with razor thin margins. They did surgery first then 30 rounds of radiation + 6 rounds of cisplatin. First off: I am fine. I was diagnosed almost 13 years ago at 24 YO, and after a really shitty 6 months my life went relatively back to normal and I have had a very successful career and great family (despite the speech impediment). People sometimes have trouble understanding me but it’s ok. 

When I was diagnosed, a friend introduced me to another girl who was also diagnosed in her early 20s - her case sounded more like you, except the cancer had broken out of the lymph nodes (I don’t remember the medical term). She had chemo first to shrink the tumor, then surgery and radiation. The chemo was very effective and she ended up with maybe 1/3 of her tongue removed (with no reconstruction). She’s still alive. 

Unfortunately every case is unique and i have been in contact with other survivors who did not make it despite better odds. Just make sure you get her in with a very good hospital - that seems to make the biggest impact. 

Please feel free to PM me!"
"I had a t4a pn0 hpv-  tumor was 6.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 with a 30mm depth of invasion. I had a hemiglossectomy and neck dissection in early Dec-22 and finished chemoradiation early March-23. I have my next scan in 2 weeks, but haven’t had a recurrence as of yet. I have a peg tube that I’m still on (multiple swallowing challenges) but otherwise would say I’m doing pretty well. It’s overwhelming and my life doesn’t look like what I thought it would, but it’s good. 

I had a lot of pain and swallowing difficulties leading up to surgery. Surgery took care of the pain I was in (healing has its own pain, but it was nothing compared to being in pain 24x7.) 

There definitely is hope but it’s a fight. Surgery is difficult (hated the trach) and chemoradiation was hell, but I started feeling better about 4 weeks after and notice improvements all the time. My radiation oncologist reminded me that healing can take up to two years, so improvement is still possible. 

Support groups was my number one thing. I joined one of FB (before I found this forum) and I loved being able to ask random questions as they came up. 

Let me know if I can answer any specific questions you may have."
"I am so sorry for your sister. Your post says a lot about you. She will need you. Support by my friends and family was my savior in my biggest life challenge thus far. 

I love that they are leading with non-surgical solutions first.  Not a doctor and just basing this on my own experience but if you are going to get zapped anyway, starting with it vs surgery makes sense to me. 

My two cents and it comes from a place of kindness, my experience, and consultation’s from multiple oncologists before choosing my own doctor/treatment.  

Feel free to DM me anytime."
"Anyone familiar with vitamin B17, amygdalin, laetril?"
"Thank you for sharing that. I’ve actually read a bunch of your comments here and the other sub I think (I recognize your username because I saw that you had a similar staging).

It seems like so often with HNC once you’ve dealt with one thing, other things pile up. It’s cruel to me. But someone in here somewhere said something that resonated with me, something to about being on the right side of the dirt. 

To be honest, your story has given me hope despite all that you are still dealing with. I hope you kick its ass. Truly."
"Thank you for this. I’ve come to understand that despite the diagnosis the treatment often works, and sometimes it doesn’t. She’s at UCSD and although not one of the top places, I hope it’s a good enough one. At least it’s a National Cancer Institute from what I’ve read. 

I’ve seen here over and over how your care team makes such a difference. What’s hardest is the vacillating between being hopeful and staying realistic but forcing yourself to take one day at a time. 

She’s in so much pain and she’s scared. She hasn’t said it but I hear it when communicating with her. Her biggest issue was pain management and she was struggling so much with that that she didn’t have a lot of time or head space for other stuff. Now she’s struggling with her airway and her biggest worry about not being able to talk after recovering from surgery. My sister is super smart and she is a heavy researcher of everything and she hasn’t done much research or reading since diagnosis about this. I’m doing it for her. I can imagine a lot of different reasons why she hasn’t and all of them break my heart a little. But I’ll do it for her. I don’t even think she is aware of how the staging for oral cancer works and I know she hasn’t deep dived her my chart like I have. She’s dealing with a lot already and this all happened so suddenly. Early April was her birthday, she was fine. Didn’t feel well, and went to urgent care three days later. CT scan then biopsy the next day and three more days and got results. Her world turned upside down so fast. 

I’m very far away and that kills me. I’m going in the next few days to be there for as long as I can. Then back and forth. I’m sure once I’m there I’ll have a better handle on what is happening with her - to just be there for her. 

This is horrendous disease just freaking awful. All of you who have been through this or are going through this are fucking brave hero’s, for real. I have no words for how strong you all are. Thank you for giving me hope."
"Thank you for this. Your two cents is worth a whole lot. I think I get what you mean about being zapped first, after reading so much here and elsewhere it seems to make sense to me too. I’m sure I’ll be in touch, thank you for being willing to chat."
"My husband was diagnosed as well, although at the time it was stage 4 throat cancer, is all they called it.  It had gone to his lymph nodes.  He’s had it return twice, dealing with the third time now.  To say this is a cruel version of a horrible disease is an understatement.  I am so sorry your sister is going through this.  All of you going through this are some strong ass warriors.  My husband is my hero, dealing with this so humbly and with grace.  He also did not research much about this.  I did it.  I am His person.  I stand between him, his fears, the doctors, the bills, the treatment, the feeding tubes, the nasty ensure, the truth, the soft food diet, the meds, and all these tiny things.  I stood up for him this last time, and reminded him that he had a choice, and his choice is all that matters, and I would make it happen.  I swore in the beginning I would never make a promise I couldn’t keep, and so far that has been the case.  She doesn’t have to research, she’s living it.  Word of caution, the internet puts the worst nastiness answers up first to all your questions.  Do not put much stock in it.  I quit googling about it years ago.  I learned what my husband needed by being with him and dealing with HIS cancer.  Be her person.  Her job is to get better and get through treatments and surgery.  Be her person one day, one question, one problem, or request at a time.  You do the rest.  You are doing great.  She sees what you are doing.  Peace and comfort to you, your sister, and all of you fighting every day.  Cancer sucks."
"Praying and wishing you well.

Dad has his staging for tongue cancer today - wish I could hug everyone going through this.

I feel like she's my sister as well right now - something about shared pain that brings us together.

With you in spirit if not in person.

Ali :)"

"I'd be interested in a feature length version of Safe Haven, so good"
Hail Ratma!
"When it comes to the segments in the V/H/S movies that are actually really good, I count my blessings that what we got was as good as it was. I'm a bit hesitant to call for a feature-length version of any of the good segments, because Amateur Night got that treatment with the movie SiREN, which I thought was terrible. Slumber Party Alien Abduction also got adapted into Kids vs. Aliens, and I haven't seen that."
"Yeah fair point, a lot of these are probably better as shorter, more focused segments"
"I might be in the minority here, but I quite liked Siren lol. Idk if I would go so far to say it's better than Amateur Night, but it was fun it its own way. You're probably right about Safe Haven, though - which is easily my favorite short of all the V/H/S films - it's about as perfect as it can get and I think expanding it into a feature length film would be risky. The only way I'd say it could be pulled off is if Gareth Evans and Timo Tjahjanto return to do it, as they're both exceptional filmmakers imho."
The thing I didn't like in Kids VS Aliens is you have no sympathy for the main characters cause from what we see they are kinda jerks themselves
"As is the case with so much short-form fiction, it’s really easy to mistake a well executed idea for one that should be explored in a feature-length format. 

A lot of Stephen King’s short stories fit this bill; they’re so well executed that you’re left wanting more, but in reality what you had was just right, and if you *did* have more you’d actually be wishing for less."
Not having kids during the trial is more out of an abundance of caution since the drug hasn’t been tested in pregnant women or children. This request is not uncommon in any drug trial.
"Seems pretty fringe science/speculative: a study of only 1 person in Moscow who had previously had a bone marrow transplant done to treat their AS (not a thing in the USA).

Reportedly, doctors were able to deplete only those T-cells which cause the AS leading to complete remission of the disease.

If safe, true, replicable and applicable to PSA (a doo-doo-ton of ""ifs""), it could functionally be a cure for us some day. 

  
My bet is that most of us will live to see ourselves cured of this crap."
"Seems like a very thin line between ""we fixed your autoimmune issues"" and ""now cancer can do what it wants!""."
"I saw a rheumatologist present on this topic recently. He said its exciting, but its so far only tested on 1 person and we're likely many years away from it being offered. But still. Some hope!"
"""live"" ... sure. if given no choice in the matter, I'm quite sure they can keep my failing body alive damn all the consequential pain and suffering as a result.

but if you want me to be cooperative and alive 15 years or so from now, it's going to take a bigger miracle than a cure, because I can't handle 15 more years of this.

I know for sure my friends can't handle it. they've mostly left at this point. only so many times you can stand someone up and talk about this never-ending saga of a disease

I know for sure my doctors can't handle it. because I've already been handed off within their practice. they say the nicest things to my face, but how much do you wanna have to control someone else's life, including the pain management that the law has told you that you aren't allowed to provide? they told it to me verbatim. they have empathy. they're good people. it hurts them to not be able to help, and so sure. I've been handed off without really being handed off. the new doctor was described to me as being ""more cavalier"" and able to help me. aka fuck the law, they know what their patients need.

I know for sure my partner can't handle it. Only so many aches and pains he can have that I really don't wanna hear about while dealing with way worse. Only so many times i can tell him to get his own support network, work with his better-feeling friends, work more with his family. Because while I love him, I have limits for what I can do. And that certainly goes for being a therapist when I'm just not in the mood to provide therapy. I can nod and smile, but the reality is I have my own issues to deal with.

sorry for the rant. it's just nothing in my life has destroyed so much than this stupid disease. nothing I have ever done, no choice I ever made, no drug I ever did, nothing, no huge mistakes.

just, this. boom. and everything is laid to waste.

again, sorry for the rant. I just do not share this optimism. I'm not so boldly going the next 15 years.

I'll add something: I'm usually the designated driver at bars. I don't like alcohol enough or the prices involved, I just go for the social part. I'll drink one, and thats it. I rarely finish it. I have a zero tolerance policy for drinking and driving. I just won't do it. To me, my worst fear for a long time was doing it once and immediately getting a DUI. They say like, one dui = 100 times of actually doing it. but knowing my luck, and fears, it would happen. 

these days I can say the idea of getting a DUI and being raked over the legal coals is almost entertaining... it now compares so little on the scale of what I've dealt with as a result of psa.

so my whole value system at this point is rather shot. it pushes you over the edge, and we adapt. but, man. at what price?"
"Are we the same person? I am in my 3rd year of UCD comp sci and whilst I haven't repeated any years, your story sounds remarkably similar (but not one-to-one) to mine. It sounds like you're a lot worse off than I am though. I got privately diagnosed this year and I'm on the tail end of the titration phase of ritalin. idk what advice I could give you since ritalin works decently well for me. I'd tell you to try the other stimulant tyvense but I'm guessing the psychiatrist doesn't want to prescribe that and you don't have the option of going private. I can't speak for strattera at all. Feel free to ask me any questions though, here or in DMs."
"lol i have the exact same issues. hope you get through it friend, this shit is no joke"
"I have 3 kids who went/going through Uni with undiagnosed ADHD/Autism (each has a different combination) and I was diagnosed very late. You can do this and it’s good to know you don’t need to be so hard on yourself, and there are options.

I was keen to keep my meds on a low dose so I use supplements as a ”top up”. I was on Concerta (slow release) but it built up in my system and I never slept, got panic attacks and endless heart palpitations. So my GP (I don’t have access to mental health services or a psychiatrist) switched me to Ritalin and I break my tablets to take lower doses on days I don’t need it and stronger doses on days that I do, but you can only do that with instant release. Then I top up with Vitamin B12 2000mg and Omega 3, 6, 9 (krill oil) 1000mg and Vitamin D3+K2 (complementary to magnesium) and last thing at night I take Magnesium L-Threonate. It’s easier to get it all on Amazon because I can’t find it locally to me. These are all based on finding a calming space.

To be honest the BEST thing I did was join ADHD Ireland who do specific workshops and online support groups for adults, students, parents and their crown jewel is the UMAAP Programme (Understanding & Managing Adult ADHD Programme) which is free & online. It looks at ADHD a different way and is truly a great programme. You DON’T need to be diagnosed to do the programme.

ADHD Ireland have a guide for secondary and college/uni but I don’t know how useful that is. You can access it through the [ADHD Ireland Guide School College](https://adhdireland.ie/for-young-people/school-and-college/) The first part is secondary school specific, so scroll down to the relevant part. 

Meds aren’t always the answer. EVERYONE I’ve met that’s done UMAAP said it’s life changing. 

Go easy on yourself. And remember this world was set up by neurotypicals for neurotypicals because they like a world where everyone does exactly what they’re told and is a yes person. Neurodivergent people who challenge the status quo make them unhappy and uncomfortable but we’re the people who get things done a different way.

[ADDitude Magazine](https://www.additudemag.com/) is a great resource and the research is legit and qualified. I searched for University and a load of articles came up - there might be some help there.

Best of luck"
"UCD CompSci grad here, got diagnosed mid-degree and now I'm still a part-time MSc student (still at UCD) while working in my graduate role.

You've got a lot going on in your post but feel free to DM me with any questions you have :) I've been through it all (failed modules, angry project teammates, extenuating circumstances applications, med shortages, crying in John Dunnion's office, etc) so I'm hopeful I can help or give some useful advice"

"I would like to go through private diagnosis and explore Lisdex as an option but the costs of college especially when the allowance I get is just about enough for transport and food will make it grueling. Although I do luckily fall into UCD's student support fund scheme but unfortunately it's just a 1 time payment but better than nothing so could maybe use that as a way to slowly build up money for a private assessment, maybe use ritalin's appetite suppression to maybe help with eating less. Just have to hope 2nd year won't be rough as hell."
Superrr rough. My self-deprecating ass would think I'm a lost cause because other people managed to make it past 1st year on their 1st attempt blah blah but I'm holding out a little bit of hope. Hoping you can get through it smoothly and find your ideal solution. Not sure about me.
Using that side effect you get to save money sounds despair as all hell. Have you thought about working? You could apply for a job working in the UCD SU shops. Their closing date for applications is the 17th and you could maybe tell them about your situation. I could maybe help you with the modules you are doing but I kinda just coasted through them myself and don't remember anything 🙃
"Ye it sounds really really terrible on paper, even the counselor has said it, but maybe some intermittent fasting might be possible to squeeze some savings. I have worked summers before in a warehouse with the help of my dad but because of some incident at the workplace, I was basically let go because of concerns that the incident could happen to me since the victim is of similar stature and age to me.  
I have no idea what it could be but the thought of having to work at an entirely new place foreign to me just triggers my anxiety. I guess I have trouble with breaking initial routines? Like having to leave first job, first house, first school etc etc. Not to mention the idea of working in something that involves interacting with people will probably break me since I have always been told by people that I'm terrible at communicating and interactions.

As for the money made from working? Well uhhhh... You can probably already assume 90% of it went into guilty pleasures that only give me a temporary joy. As well as the fact that I have a fear of thinking that even if I do get private diagnosis and treatment, it would all be in vain because either all treatment options don't work or if one does work, I still end up performing terribly academically because I was born to not be smart or something along those lines.  
(Got tiger parents so academic progress is the only thing about me that they care about as well as the only thing about myself I see value in because of this upbringing.) 

I guess I can hope for the HSE Adult Mental Health services to become more accessible as opposed to being exclusive to certain catchment areas but who knows if that will happen soon or miles down the road considering this has been one of the biggest criticisms the entirety of Ireland has had for its own health services :/ Appreciate the offer to help with modules but I would not want anyone to deal with how slow my brain is, not even my worst enemies! You've got a golden heart."
">Administration of RGLS8429 has shown clear improvements in kidney function, size, and other measures of disease severity in preclinical models.

This is the part I care about, but kind of vague. Any more detailed results from the other cohorts?"
fingers crossed
"Preclinical is not really...much to put hope in...there have been a lot of things that worked in preclinicals but not in human trials, sadly.

TKV/size is going to be the deciding factor (I would think) at least to me its the key thing. if the TKV reverses/shrinks, more than likely the decline will stop along with it, or greatly slow down.

If you prevent decline...but your kidneys keep growing, you are going to end up with such a low quality of life, I'm not sure I would consider it worth it.

No, there really isnt any solid data yet other than cohort 2 had a dose dependent reaction to the drug and the 2 with the greatest reaction had a >4% reduction in TKV over 3 months. We don't know if the others had any reduction at all though, or even if they kept growing, and 2 people at 4% is within margin of error for MRI's too."

This company is a scam
"No it's not - Raza Bokahri was kicked out as CEO and has nothing to do with the company anymore as he tried to funnel $12,000,000 FSD is not a scam they have real IP for Multiple Sclerosis"
Anthony Durkacz still on the board it's a scam that guys the king of pump and dumps
That is libel and irresponsible comment FSD needs all the support It can get to advance to phase 2 clinical trials my friend.
Well good thing they've got delusional pumpers like yourself to spread their garbage
Remyelinating therapy for MS coming closer to phase 2
"So, wouldn’t this trial have to be repeated in North America to achieve US FDA approval?  And is the Australian framework accelerated since there’s no drugs on market for this currently?  I’m trying to look for a “patient impact” silver lining, but I think im just seeing a press release for long term shareholders.."
"Unfortunately, there are still years of waiting for this medicine if it doesn't fail during phases 2 and 3 😞 I heard from one of the medicinal researchers that before phase 3 it's senseless to get excited. 

Overall it's good information but doesn't say anything relevant to us now."

"To compare similar r/r patient group, we should compare Uproleselan and SLS009, right? And in that case SLS009 is much more promissing. Maybe it’s not that straight forward, but please correct me."
"Thanks Gabri, interesting read as always!"
"Any info on the OS in the Cr2 subset in this study?In each arm, without Sct"
"Hi Gabri,
Would you be able to clarify the difference in populations between the viale p3 trial for aza-ven vs. The P3 regal trial.

I'm having trouble detmermining how the 14.7month OS from viale relates to the regal group. I know there is a broader criteria for patients in that trial.

Also, when tabulating the OS would deaths from side effects be excluded or included in the outcome and OS? It states 23% of patients had fatal events caused by the treatments. GPS has been observed to have little/no side effects in most patients. 

Thanks."
"the r/r AML patients treated with SLS009 are much more difficult to be treated than the ones in the uproleselan trial, because the SLS009 Study exclusively selects the r/r AML patients with a previous documented failure of VEN (this is not the case for Uproleselan) which is associated with a very poor mOS of 2.5-3 months. So no, we cannot compare the two drugs because they target patients with a different prognostic profile (the one in SLS009 being much worse)"
"Out of the 54 r/r AML in this Ph1/2 study, 22 reached a CR/CRi2 state. 17 of them underwent Stem cell transplant. 5 CR2 did not. There is no info on the outcome for these 5CR2 patients."
"Hi, VIALE-A is an **induction treatment** for previously untreated patients with confirmed AML who are ineligible for standard induction therapy because of coexisting conditions, because they are 75 years of age or older, or both.  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32786187/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32786187/)

Deaths due to side effects count for the calculation of the Overall Survival.

REGAL is **a maintenance treatment** for AML patients in CR2 without the prospect of undergoing stem cell transplant.

Then, we have a different Phase 3 trial called **VIALE-M** (M stands for maintenance). It is oral Azacitidine with or without Venetoclax as maintenance in CR1 AML patients). It is closed for enrollment, results not yet published. Looking forward to seeing those results"
"How are you having a hard time? 

VIALE os of 14.7 MOS is for FRONT LINE, Newly DIAGNOSED, Previously Untreated Patients.

deaths from side effects of course are INCLUDED -- you have been infected by the short con."
"Alright, this is clicking. I believe since current guidelines say ven/aza and ven/dec is reserved for those ≥60yo w/ comorbidities, you’re able to confidently state that GLYC’s r/r population is healthier, no? 

GLYC trial participants were eligible even if they had received 1 HSCT (>4mo prior). During the trial they received MEC or FAI. Because these were even options, it tells us the population was inherently healthier.

A documented failure of VEN essentially means SLS009 participants have no therapeutic options aside from another course of Ven/Aza or Ven/Dec, otherwise they’d be eligible for MEC/FLAG-ida/other therapy options (I’d assume). Thus, they’re forced back to a VEN-combo which is futile and results in a much lower mOS.

Gabri’s saying it’s like comparing apples to oranges - you can’t compare healthier, younger r/r AML patients to older/sicker r/r AML patients. The healthier patients have access to HSCT and better chemotherapy regimens.

If I’m totally off I’m going to delete this post (to avoid confusion) and scourge myself."
"The fact there is no info on the out come, is telling.

The outcome is very poor."
By the time patients get into CR2 / Ven Aza will have exhausted its Use.
"Not at all. I am simply asking a question of someone who has much greater understanding of biotech and specifically the AML field. I have a whopping 2.5 months of experience researching biotech since I started investing so as much as I have learned a ton, I will lean on those with more knowledge to backup what I have learned."

If you spent half as much time researching stocks and putting together a plan for investing/ trading rather then getting all emotional about one stock maybe you would have more success. May I ask why you want to keep adding to a losing position?  What is the plan? Average down then hold for the long term? I usually do the opposite and add to my winners on the corrections (if in an uptrend)
"So, my electric battery SHOT followers (neg. & pos.). The trend for SHOT is still down. If this trend continues we should see SHOT between $.95 to $1.02 per share by Friday at the close. No significant news (good or bad) will be coming for at least the next 3 weeks. So, all shorts should be considering selling @ around $1.00. Buyers should wait until it falls below $1.00. I’ll be watching for a signal that it has bottomed for my next buy, at which time I will be adding another 3k shares. Life is short, enjoy each day. 🥃😁"
I called for SS to fall to $1.02 to $.90 by the end of the end of the week. It  low of $1.13 today. Will it go lower by end of day? 🤷‍♂️ How low can it go? I want to know . $.90 or lower would really be nice. 😁 I just have question for those posting here about SHOT. Are you a stick holder and have you actually tried the drink?
"I heard the reason the study is delayed is because Safety Shot was too effective and the participants can no longer feel any effects of alcohol, doomed to a lifetime of sobriety.  They fucked up the ratios of filtered water, caffeine, and ginseng.  That’s why there’s no repeat buyers on Amazon, nobody can get drunk anymore so there’s no reason to buy more Safety Shot."
"you are so dumb 😂😂😂
You come to this SAFETY SHOT sub to tell me, what i should do with my money?
you think i'm emotional about my investment? You are wrong. I'm emotional about fraudsters, bashers, liars in this sub and other subs, people that spend their time shitting on investors and badmouthing their investment, while shorting it and profiting off the regular investors, that listen to their shit talk. Like leeches. Contributing nothing of value to the society.


Yes, sometimes i'm a bit emotional about these kind of asshats.


But i'm absolutely calm when it comes to my investment decision into Safety Shot. I see the future and the potential. And i like what i see 😉"
"Attention Alcoholics: Don’t drink Safety Shot, you’ll never get drunk again. No more need for AA meetings, no more therapy required, Safety Shot is your path to recovery. Now that is the funniest thing I have ever heard. 🥃🥃🥃😂"
"Did you drink a safety shot after drinking alcohol, and did you test your results with a breathalyzer? Because I did, and I did NOT like what I see. You claim to be emotional about fraudsters... we'll see how emotional you get when this fraudulent company gets exposed.

And you won't be able to say that you weren't warned."
"You’ll love the story about my buddy then.  He was drinking safety shot all night and got stopped at a DUI checkpoint, the cop made him chug a beer before he could drive off because he was too sober.  This shit is dangerous."
lol 😂
He hasn’t tested it. He literally has no idea. 🤦🏻‍♂️
"For years now, i see accounts like yours, that are screeming fraud and scam in tandem with so called research agencies (Shortseller, that are writing very long and detailed hit pieces.

Your bashing accounts are easy to spot (not easy to proof but, i mean.....come on....you guys are so obviouse in being trash).


If the company is a scam, i'm all for it, that they rott in jail.
But what i see are allagations by shortsellers (Capybara) and their paid accounts (you), like i saw it many many times. And in this case, i want to see you rott in jail.

Thanks a lot. 👏👏👏
Anytime!
I take it and haven't noticed any side effects. No big improvements either.
"It's an immunosuppressant, so some of the more serious side effects, if you Google, will be things like cancer and stuff like that. It's the rheum's job to determine if the benefit of you taking it outweighs the risk. The decision is also, of course, up to you.

I take azathioprine and have not had any serious side effects. Maybe a week of upset stomach when I started? It's hard to remember. Everyone has different reactions to different drugs, but the main adverse reactions to azathioprine, from my understanding, is GI distress. A good way to avoid this with a lot of meds is to titrate up, but obviously ask your doctor first. From my understanding azathioprine is generally well-tolerated.

Edit- a good trial period for a rheumatic drug would be at least three months, though six would be better. They take forever to get into your system and start working."
"I’m on it. I have zero side effects and I must say that I’m grateful. My rheumy warned me that I’d feel really nauseous or throw up and I was looking out for that side effect, but no such thing."
"Hello. Symptoms can vary depending on the individual. That’s what I said to myself before I was diagnosed “I don’t have butterfly rashes, my arms or legs are not swollen, I don’t have mouth ulcers so it can’t be lupus.” 

If you look up the Lupus Umbrella Diagram, there are 6 pillars that address which body part/organs Lupus attacks first. Lupus nephritis affects the kidneys, cutaneous lupus affects only the skin, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome affects the blood and so on. 

So for my case, Lupus went straight for my kidneys, which is why I didn’t have any physical symptoms like skin rashes, mouth ulcers. A lot was happening internally like proteins in my urine, low proteins in blood, anemia, etc. Make sure you talk to your Rheu and get more test done if needed. A proper diagnose will give you a better understand on your condition."
"I’ve never been on this med, but pretty much every single immunosuppressant med I’ve taken over the last 24 years for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has lymphoma as a potential side effect. It’s something to pay attention to, but don’t obsess about it. Be a compliant patient, go to your doctor appointments on the schedule that they want to see you, take your meds, get your labs done as they are ordered, get your screenings on schedule. Be vigilant about paying attention to your body and bring up anything weird quickly. The most important thing is to have a good relationship with your doctors and develop that level of trust, confidence and understanding with them. They are your partners in this lifelong health journey. They will have your back. Hang in there, I’m sorry you’re going through this. It’s scary, and it sucks, but it’s manageable."
I took it for over 5 years and did really well on it. It helped me go into remission.
"Azathioprine has been pretty great for me.  For any of the “scarier” potential side effects, you will have blood tests which should help mitigate risk.  Usually you can slowly increase or decrease dose to hit a dose that helps you while minimizing other side effects.

One reason I was given AZA was because it’s good for skin and joint pain.  Even though you don’t have skin stuff going on, it might still help with other symptoms!  

With dsDNA being positive, it’s VERY VERY likely you have lupus - “false negatives” for that test aren’t the most common, but even in the case of false negatives people with positive dsDNA do still usually have one or more other diseases - so I’d be willing to wager whatever other symptoms you have are related to your increased dsDNA antibodies.

I started HCQ and AZA at the same time so I can’t be sure which drug decreased my dsDNA antibody titer, but it will be cool if after trying out AZA for a bit, a repeat test is done if you have less symptoms and can see if less symptoms correlated with less or negative anti-dsDNA antibody (often in Lupus at least, severity of symptoms increases with dsDNA although this is not always the case).  

Make sure if they haven’t already, that they do a TPMT enzyme test.  TPMT is a key enzyme that processes out AZA, so if you turn up to be a LOW or INTERMEDIATE metabolizer (less TPMT activity than most people), you’ll want to increase dosage of AZA in smaller increments to make sure all is well.  Low and intermediate metabolizers can be at higher risk for side effects, so the smaller dosage changes up are good for making sure your blood counts don’t get negatively effected.  This isn’t the only enzyme that metabolizes AZA, so like…. I’m an intermediate metabolizer so I went up doses slowly but I guess my other enzyme is cool so I’m able to be on the same maximum dose as a normie :- )

Because I started both HCQ and AZA at once, it’s hard to say how long until I felt positive effects for AZA, but I do notice more joint pain, fatigue, headache, heart rate issues, etc if I go down my dose within maybe a month and a half.

I’m jumping around a bit because ADHD and also excitement about talking about drugs, so I’m sorry about the confusing novel.

Lymphoma is a listed risk, but you will get regular blood testing as your dose is adjusted up over time and then when you’re on a stable dose, every 3-4 months.

If it helps, I read a recent publication from 2020 that suggests azathioprine might not even be the cause for increased risk of lymphoma - it is a 2020 meta analysis that looked at ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s patients with or without azathioprine prescription - and incidendence of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma was the same in both groups suggesting the underlying disease may be the cause.  Most papers before this looking at lymphoma in azathiorpine prescribed patients are using Crohn’s and UC patients.  It IS found there is increased risk of melanoma - so use your sunscreen and practice safe sun habits!"
"I'm on it.  Starting it was rough but that was because I was tapering off prednisone and dealing with blood sugar challenges on top of everything.

The most notable side effect I had was nausea.  I found taking it at night time was helpful.  

I imagine there must be a significant reason for your health care professionals to jump to this medication.  I've been placed on it due to lupus attacking my platelets.  

Overall I've been on it for the better part of a year and it has helped keep my disease activity in check but I am also on plaquenil and saphnelo infusions.  

I will say that I've been through the ringer the past 3 weeks with a respiratory infection.  First viral but I think I had a secondary bacterial infection as well.  Had to get some antibiotics and finally seeing some improvement.  Basically I have to be cautious of bacterial infections due to the suppression of the immune system."
On and off it haven't noticed much of a difference
"I recently switched over from Cellcept in Feb, now at our goal of 150mg daily.. I must say I really felt the change the first few weeks, beyond tired, upset stomach, and light headed. I have since came back to my “normal” and feel good. Lmk if you have any questions!"
Thank you. I hate taking meds and in the last year it’s just been med after med. it’s unnerving. So thank you. I appreciate the response.
Lucky!  😅 I struggled with the nausea but was able to get through it.
"I understand. I don't have issues with meds, but I know lots of people do. People these days with lupus are living longer and longer, and part of that is due to the meds we take. Life expectancy for someone with a lupus diagnosis used to be 5-10 years; now it's nearly normal."
I started the article excited but quickly deflated. The finding about calcium channels into the cells being broken is good. The more evidence we build the better.  And reversing it with naltrexone is welcome. But we know that LDN helps but doesn’t fix ME/CFS. I don’t think the 100 person trial is going to tell us anything we don’t know already. Surely there is a better use for researchers time and money.
"I was in an LDN trial at Stanford until recently (left voluntarily but still take 6 mg nightly). Stanford only took blood samples at the start; they didn’t regularly collect and look at blood samples/cell activity. It also was not double blind, everyone received the drug. I think this study is building on that work, which is great to see."
"Low dose nalterxone  (LDN) has been in use for ages; 

The griffith TPRM3 calcium ion hypothesis has been around for ages too

This is the first time I've seen them married like this, with evidence of effectiveness in vitro. I'm wondering what *aspect* of the cells function was restored by LDN."
"I disagree! Firstly, many doctors still won’t prescribe LDN and having studies back its efficacy is probably the only thing that will help to change that. But further - we currently don’t know how it works and why it helps some and not others. If we can understand the mechanisms behind its activity better, we may be able to use it more effectively, or open up avenues for different treatments."
"I try to look at it this way: if they're catching up to the stuff we've already discovered about ME/CFS, then soon they have to try new stuff right?

....right?"
Do we actually already have real studies and paper exploring this? A PhD student would not re-do something like that.
Totally agree. we already know LDN sort of works a little bit for some people .. lets put these resources into trying something new!
"I believe the ion channel thing has already been a topic of research in chronic pain. An australian dr I tried to get in to see researches it.


Edit: I was misremembering, the dr I am thinking of was researching sodium channels, not calcium channels. And I think he may have been a fraud, but I am not sure."
"Hard Agree. Wish they'd stop fannying about trying to reinvent the wheel over and over. LDN is helpful to some but by no means anywhere near a cure. It's used at harmlessly low doses, it is the easiest thing in the world to get hold of with or without Rx, and a single 50mg tablet can be dissolved into solution that will provide about 2 weeks' worth of doses. For the love of God why can't they just trial something of substance!"
"Jarred Younger keeps on trying to test dextro-naltrexone, but he's not been able to as of yet.  It's nice to see this space slowly changing and more funding starting to be available."
"I’m not aware of such studies (but that doesn’t meant there isn’t any). I think there is strong consensus in the community that LDN works a bit for some people. My guess is that is what the trial will show. If true, it doesn’t really change the life of anyone with me/cfs. It’s just confirmation of a well accepted theory."
"You do need empirical evidence to motivate fundings for other directions. This study may also show that LDN is useless in their case study, opening a new scientific question around why it is helpful for some people. It’s good that the community consensus gets challenged by empirical studies."
"> I think there is strong consensus in the community that LDN works a bit for some people. My guess is that is what the trial will show. If true, it doesn’t really change the life of anyone with me/cfs.

I get that everyone wants to jump straight to a big perfect cure, but that isn't going to happen. Instead we formalise what is already known and proceed by inches.

1. published evidence is better than a strong consensus

2. if they can define a susbet LDN works on that will be amazing; not solely because it allows the drug to be targeted but becuase then we know a bit more about the mechanism of the disease."
"**CRISPR gene therapy improves vision in people with inherited blindness. Phase 1/2 trial of Brilliance showed promising results in vision improvement in people with inherited retinal disorders:** Results from a clinical study suggest that EDIT-101, Editas Medicine's CRISPR-based gene editing therapy for an inherited form of Leber’s congenital amaurosis (LCA), is safe and efficacious.

Moreover, the therapy resulted in several clinically meaningful improvements in vision. The trial, which included the first patient to ever receive a CRISPR-based investigational medicine directly inside the body, was focused primarily on safety with a secondary analysis for efficacy. Participants were monitored every three months for one year, and then followed less frequently for two additional years.

"Where do you live? One of the things I focused on when I was researching MBA options was which school's alumni had a big presence where I currently live. Online MBAs are often a resume check box, so it's good if it's a school that carries some weight where you are. 

Broadly speaking, more people are familiar with Nebraska than South Dakota, so I'd lean that way all else being equal."
I will be living and working in rural western Pennsylvania. My plan was to work here for two years while completing my MBA. So there aren't really any ties to either school in my location. But I did assume it would just be a resume checkbox. I would have considered a bigger school like BU or U ILL but they only matriculate in the Fall and Spring and I wanted to start this Summer. My situation is a little strange and unorthodox because I also do want to try to apply for residency this Fall and thought maybe the MBA would look good on the application along with the teaching.
What you probably don't know is that the team of scientists who created the medicine most likely live in sub par conditions. They probably got a nice pat on the back and a bicycle for helping Cuba make millions with this medicine. Source: My uncle was on the team that created a famous pill and all he got was a bike with the title of the bike signed by Fidel himself.
"Hey slow kid,

Nobody, least of all the people on this thread,  think Cubans incapable of performing science.  So what? We know that not a penny of this discovery will be used to improve the lives of the Cuban people, just to enrich the corrupt government.  That's evil."
"Nobody here says Cuban bio Pharma is bad, they are really good, and mostly go to international markets, now when you compare vs the hospitals and quality of care and medicine availability in the island is when you see most of the complaints."
Nazi Germany had some very talented scientists. Incredible breakthroughs by the biotech industry is not really a reflection of the quality of life on the island.

"Releasing a vaccine doesn’t ignore the fact that people get 15 years in prison for filming a protest. That there’s no freedom of expression, of press, of assembly, of thought. Or that the quality of life of the common people is terrible, especially for old people."
"What’s the issue here?  Noone ever said that Cuba has incompetent scientists, so it doesn’t surprise me that they made a good drug.  That’s not the criticism of the Cuban system. 

Cuba has always been able to achieve impressive things that garner prestige for the state (like Angola)."
But are they able to produce any without electricity for 18 hours a day?
Brace yourself— earth shattering reality incoming.  Two things can be true
"This is kind of a straw man. Medicine can’t be “communist” only governments. Cubans don’t discredit the quality of doctors in Cuba. Cuba has very talented doctors. It’s the management of them that’s terrible. 

Also, dedicating all your resources to medicine will yield good results. But at what expense though? That’s our problem"
Oh man I bet OP believes Cuba cured cancer too
"This is an interesting post. Can the OP explain how this “cutting edge” medication’s clinical trial approved by the FDA slipped through the cracks of the “evil embargo”? Asking for an “anti-Cuban” friend! 

FYI; there’s nothing more “anti-Cuban” than the dictatorship in Havana, but good try! You idiots love to come up with lame labels to demonize the opposition and manipulate the narrative. Since “gus@no” is a censored word here now you’re switching to “anti-cubano” para burlar la censura."

"I’m so confused by some of these people. Do they really think that Cuban “*isn’t*” n subpar conditions? That the people of Cuba aren’t suffering daily with food shortages, clean water, electricity? Or basic human dignities? 

I’m as liberal as they come, but these Che Guevara tshirt wearing dumbfucks are really lost."
Can you please clarify  who do you call “anti Cubans”?
"Now imagine if Cuba didn't have such a restrictive government.  Cuba has much potential.  That is the argument all ""anti-Cubans"" make."
"Let me clear your head, Cuba's Health concerns are not because of the professionals, It's because there's no intention from behalf of the government to supply Hospitals, not even a simple repair, plus there's shortage of everything you can name that a Health institution needs, the only people that have top 1st world access to medical treatment are tourists and the leaders, Cuba has a lot of talent not only good doctors but none of that serves no purpose if you have to work in an OR fill with cockroaches. Add to that that most of those patents are not property of Cuba but to the Chinese and Russian government, as they have sold their patents in agriculture and so far, everyone respects Cubans because with even the limitations they have they manage to perform"
It's good to see Heberprot-P approved by the FDA for clinical trials in the US because it is yet another powerful reminder of existing opportunities for US-Cuba cooperation in the medical field. The loud criticism by staff of Joe Biden's successful 2020 presidential election campaign at Bernie Sanders for doubling down on his complimentary comments about Fidel Castro's social services for rural Cubans in a February 2020 interview on *60 Minutes* was why Joe Biden's administration reminds itself that privately acknowledging Cuba's advances in the field of medicine are not a prelude to praising Castro for promoting free-of-charge medical facilities for rural Cubans.
"this is like asking homeopathic doctor how to cure cancer  
a really bad idea"

So much propaganda but it never fully convinces the useful idiots abroad to migrate to Cuba. They always choose to defend the dictatorship from the comforts of Capitalism! LOL
This is a awesome! The researchers at CNGM were talking about this when I visited last year. I'm happy that this finally got approved.
“Title of the bike”. You mean like car title?
" Scientists who work for big Pharma in the US just get their salary.  The company founder/owner owns the valuable patent, not them.  Just saying."
I'm sorry your uncle your uncle couldn't hoard wealth while others starve.
"Thats a lie. Show the proofs ? Come on, show here the numbers of the accounts ? Even the CIA cant show it !."
"The hospitals and the quality care are directly related to the consecuences of the economic war of USA. I was with my father in a hospital until he dies in july 2021.

"because that shows the lies about Cuba...CUba is show in this sub like a place worst than Haití. They never said here that, for example, Cuba create at least 3 vaccines against Covid19...and all the cuban people and even mexicans, venezuelans, were vaccinated with those vaccines..

If you tell them that Roswell Park institute is cooperating with Cuba to test the cuban vaccine Cimavax against lunst cancer in USA, they could tell u ""thats propaganda""  although even PBS made a documentary about that.

If you tell  them  than we have USA young people studying medicine in Cuba, they told you ""thats a communist propaganda""..."
"Agree 100%.  I'm as liberal as they come as well but reality is, what it is.  Really not worth arguing with them, they'll always believe that Che was the consummate humanitarian when in fact, he was a murderer.  They'll always believe Fidel improved the lot of Cubans when in fact, he destroyed the country.  They'll always believe health care and education in Cuba is top notch without acknowledging that the ""great"" health care is only available to foreigners and the top echelons of the state and that education in Cuba is nothing more than indoctrination.  Cuba developed a pill, whoop dee doo.  The developers will get an e-bike and an extra ration of rice.  Congratulations!!!"
"Dude I have made this argument for over 20 years, when talking to communists I always ask why don’t you GO to Cuba? Their heads explode. Like 0.001% of communists actually move to communist countries lol. I think part of a communist spirit is just revolution for sake of revolution. Undermining and subverting traditional governments is just what these people convince themselves life is about"

Hasta la alemania nazi tuvo puntos positivos.
No hay relacion alguna entre Cuba produciendo cierto medicamento, ser una dictadura y tener al pueblo en la mas absoluta miseria.

"They want to parasite where the capitalist wealth is, not where it used to be."
"""If you love capitalism so much, why don't you go to war torn areas in Israel?""

That's how absurd your own argument is... People are moving to richer countries all the time. Always. Billions of people migrate from capitalist countries to other capitalist countries due to poverty... From Exploited countries, to the countries that do the exploiting. It's like saying ""people in british colonies move over to the UK. That's proof that the UK is better"". A country that exploits others is fundamentally gonna be better off, than the exploited ones... How does that correlate to that country's system actually being better, even in the slightest?? Maybe we shouldn't glorify a system that stands on the Robbery of others?

Your argument completly undermines why countries are poor or rich to begin with..."
It can probably pull some serious cash in collectors circles.
"""Like all other technology companies, drug companies have their employees assign all their patents to them. **Employees who get a patent granted typically get a small bonus in return**."""

"I think if I were a communist id try to say China is still communist since government owns much of the economy and they still have the red flag etc. Then id try to claim their success as communist W's. I think thats the easiest path. And if someone brings up Cuba you just say there are capitalist countries poorer than Cuba. 

I'm not making these arguments myself Im just saying I think there are smarter ways to do pro communist stuff on the internet."
"Keep talking to yourself while ignoring reality.

Ignore all of history. Ignore all of external affairs. Ignore all of corruption.

It's much easier to just form a worldview of ""just trade, everyone consents, so it must be good"" and say ""socialism bad"" instead of criticially analyzing the issues... You have the mindset of a 15 year old Teenager in the US... I seriously hope you grow out of that Phase one day..."
"Nope my argument is as simple as “if you like country with x economic system, you’d go there instead of changing your own countries’ economic system” that’s literally what you just argued lol. Billions of People migrate due to economic reasons."
I'm pretty sure he already used that paper to wipe his ass...lol
I didn’t say that. I’m not even going to address just how stupid that is. That is one of the biggest logical fallacies I’ve ever seen…
Your mother gets stuffed by Gusanos every night for soap probably.
Show me the proof
I often hear from them that China communism is proof that communism works.
I wish I was 15 and in the US! At that age I was doing forced child labor for the communist dictatorship you defend from the comforts of Capitalism. Perhaps that's what you need to suffer to finally understand what impoverishing socialism is about in practice
"Again, you are confusing economic system with general quality of the country.

You can the concept of economy X, but that doesn't mean you have to like country Z that uses economy X, if its quality of the country is bad. The economy can certainly be a factor to the quality, but in many cases, factors such as exploitation, invasions, sanctions, etc. or even just simple corruption. That's why quality also doesn't actually 1:1 correlate to the actual morality or quality of the general system. You can have a great system but be exploited or corrupted. You can be a terrible system, but exploit others. 

Again, if the decision of where people move was just the economic system, then millions of people would go to capitalist countries, even if their quality is poor. And that's what you are arguing here. That people should go to socialist countries with poor quality. How is this different to advocating to go to capitalist countries with poor quality?"
That guy reads a book of logical fallacies before he logs on Reddit lol. It’s like pulling teeth trying to have an honest argument with him

"All socialist countries are poor quality lol. Cuba had way better quality before it was communist. All it fuckin took was a return to democracy and Cuba would be way better off lol. In Cuba’s case, Z country is bad because of economic system X. Communists argue that Cuba is good and/or better than it used to be but won’t go there. And pre revolution Cuba had way more immigrants to it and way less emigrants out of it. After revolution Cuba had wayyyy more emigrants out of it and way less immigrants into it."
This guy has never read a book and lies about what happened to his family. I'd take what he says with a grain of salt.
Stop talking about your gusano loving mother like that.
Show the fucking proof or gtfo with your false dichotomy. Imagine comparing a member of an armed political organization to a single mother recording a protest. The stupid audacity of you people never cease to amuse me.
"I mean, that's already kinda skipping the conversation before it really began. All you were settling in now is saying ""all of them are poor quality"", despite that not only ignoring the actual argument, but also already establishing the groundworks into just bashing an economic system. You aren't discussing ""is this argument really valid?"" but rather ""capitalism > socialism"". If you want to discuss that, sure, but it's leaving the scope of the initial conversation or expands it to rather unreasonable amounts if you do actually come back to it, somehow using that conclusion."
"Guarantee you've never been to Cuba, let alone live there and yet you have an opinion like you know what you're talking about. It's so easy to be a communist from Canada."

"Why are communists so obsessed with changing the entire fabric of the United States instead of moving to cuba? It’s a fair question and one that you didn’t answer nor connected to how my argument is flawed. Most Communists never actually live or have ever lived in communist countries. My argument isn’t flawed because it remains, why do advocates for economic system x never actually freely live in said economic systems? It’s a disingenuous desire which seems to have ulterior motives because you don’t *actually* want communism itself, you want to change the system that exists"

"The reason is, as I explained before: Quality of a country =/= Quality of a general System.

If you don't, then all you actually do is ideologic talking..."

I’m not entirely aware of other countries but there seems to have been a general trend of communism ruining a country. Cuba, North Korea, China, Russia, Vietnam, etc. no communist ever wants to go to these places. Even in the case of the Soviet Union, no one was moving there and the countries annexed all wanted to leave"

It’s so easy to catch you mfs in your own web of lies and deceptions. The guy literally killed an officer and you pricks pretend to compare it to a mother filming a fucking protest. You’re insanely stupid. Get help and fuck right off 🖕"
"And equally, there seems to be a Trend among capitalist countries being rather poor. The only exclusions are specfically countries that have completly invaded, imperialist or straightup enslaved other countries in order to gather wealth, eg. Colonial countries such as most of central europe, ones that split from those countries such as US or Australia, etc.

The riches of a country barely ever actually conclude from its economic system, but just how it plunders the riches of others. And in capitalism specifically, this is an imbedded system. 

Furthermore, the world isn't just as simple as ""country Z has economic system X, and has a good quality, therefore system X is also good"". It has as mentioned, countless of moving parts that influence the actual politics. You can have capitalism with completly free markets with 0 restrictions, or you can have capitalism with restricted planned economies. The outcomes and actual decisions people in Power can make will vary by a long shot. Or heck, the amount they want to give to their actual people can make the biggest distinction.

Equally, concluding ""The Soviet Union closed down, therefore it was bad"" is equally nothing but just observing the surface while ignoring the history. And heck, when ignoring the history and consequences, this argument is just nothing but even victim blaming :P... Shockers is, external affairs exist. It ignores all the actual events that have taken place. All the statistics that showcase how well a country was doing for its historic place, and even how the people were feeling.

In the majority of cases, the countries were doing MUCH better than their capitalist counterparts, who had equal developmental progress at that time. Studies comparing their Quality of Life showcase this. The keypoint here is to compare countries that have equal conditions... That's the scientific method. If you compare a prior slave state with dozens of sanctions and internal corruption, to a colonial and imperial Super Power such as France, then you are obviously gonna bias the results in your favor... Another thing to mention about the general state of the USSR, was the fact its economy (GDP per Capita) grew by over 1600% in its lifetime. Compareably, the US and other even imperalist countries didn't even grew by 100% in that same time. The state of the same countries after the reforms is also not really favorable towards capitalism. A lot of countries still to this day have worse economies than they had back then. And even for those that have finally increased it by now, the setback of the reform results in a lower total economy that they could've had, if they didn't have the reform to begin with. Even towards the argument ""many wanted to leave the USSR"", just being wrong. A good majority want it back, even by now. Russia 2018 -> 66%. Ukraine 2011 -> 82%. Belarus, Moldova and Armenia 2017 -> 54%, 70% and 79% respectively. All saying their country went worse after the downfall of the USSR. Literally nobody actually wanted it, so you can probably tell that it wasn't really much of a democratic decision, was it?"
"""He was in fear for his life"" it's so easy to catch you idiot libertarians"
I don't care if pigs die especially American pigs
"No, capitalist countries aren’t poor lol. You’re thinking of third world countries. USA didn’t even do much overseas till late 19th century and it was very wealthy. GDP is fine except at what cost did USSR implement policies that resulted in GDP? And it was the only fully Marxist country. 

Once again, in Cuba’s case, the economic system is the reason for its bad shape. It was in better shape overall before."
"Says the comepinga who literally compares the killing of a police officer to filming a protest. “hE wAs iN fEaR fOr hiS liFe”, really? In fucking NJ do you think they wouldn’t have released the guy if he didn’t do it, if he had a good case? The bastion of Trump-hating liberal democrats? Triple comemierda. You show how ignorant and viciously deceitful you are every time you try to compare the two."
"So what? They are involved in the capitalist process. Even if you are gonna say ""that isn't real capitalism"", other countries still exploit them. What kind of reasoning is this supposed to be? You're creating an orthodox argument, in which all things good happening in capitalism are due to capitalism, and all bad things happening in relations to it just aren't capitalism? It's still slavery. Even if you make it happen in their own countries. Does it suddenly not make it that, just because it doesn't happen in your own backyard? Was slavery not done in capitalist countries because the slaves didn't contribute to the capitalist market by themselves? This argument is beyond absurd...

Also, what is that ""the US didn't do much overseas till late 19th century""?? Did you just forget the entire atlantic slave trades that happened basically since its creation? I would heavily consider that imperalism lmao

To your second question. Well, would you wanna answer that yourself? The statistics that look at the Quality of Life in those countries Show a pretty good picture if you ask me, something that Displays objective consequences, and not individual Events...

And ""for cubas case"" is the same you can say for all socialist countries. In basically all of their cases, life got drastically worse after going for capitalism. If you wanna use this argument for being anti-socialism, then you have to acknowledge all the reverse arguments that would speak for anti-capitalism. You can't just cherry pick them."

There are right-wing extremists that have killed cops and have a much lenier sentence than any on the left"

Then coming off with no other counter argument other than utter “muh fascism” like your lot of useful idiots regularly do. You couldn’t even show a proof that would help your point. Bozo."
"And all I am pointing out is how:

a) this argument is hypocritical, as it can be used on capitalist countries too.

b) ""communism"" not being the sole factor, as observed by other socialist countries as well.

Your Statement was ""socialists don't go to cuba despite it being socialist"" and argued in the defense of it being a poor country, that it is socialism that does this. Your Statement is therefore only valid if your argument towards that is as well. And... well, it wasn't. That's all I Pointed out :P"
"You're the reactionary one here, pal
And yes she deserved to go to jail and sundiata didn't


And I did show proof also did most of the work in this conversation"
"It’s not hypocritical because communists make arguments in favor of communism while in capitalist countries and it is not the other way around. No one moves to communist countries they just bother capitalists. Meanwhile people move out of communist countries to capitalist countries in droves. You’re arguing straw men with loaded questions. I can’t speak for Vietnam, but Cuba was definitely better and only one thing made it worse. Communism"

Thank you for showing the world your true colors. Go read Mein Kampt or something. Fuck off you little Hitler."
"Again. People don't move for an economic system. They move for how well it is in the country. You even accepted this point yourself just some comments earlier, so how come you now suddenly completly omit that? Your objection was that socialism always (or generally) causes a country to do bad, which I disproved, just for you to backpaddle to the first argument.

And even for your ""people don't want to move to socialist countries"" point. Yes they do? Tons of subreddits here are about moving or Visiting, with dozens of people wanting to go to socialist countries. And I have already showcased to you earlier that a huge majority of people in eastern europe want socialism. Do they just not count for your example?... But either way, this doesn't matter at the end. I have already made my point before. People don't move to poorer countries. Why should they? 

You can argue that Cuba got worse after the socialist reforms, but that doesn't make it to ""socialism makes every country poor""..."
"Lol the woman that engaged in counter revolutionary (CIA psyops) is better than the panther who defended himself against a pig?

"Show the emigration vs immigration numbers of socialist nations. Put your money where your mouth is. Disprove that people leave socialist nations at least double the amount that move in. Since we both know the answer to this, I’ll argue against what you’ll predictably argue again. You think they do bad because of other reasons besides economic. Ok, prove it. Prove that these countries overall quality of life is caused by things other than communism"
Show me proof she was working for the CIA. I dare you! I double dare you! You don’t have cojones to show a factible proof because there is NONE. You fascist always gaslighting people when they don’t agree with your bullshit. Straight from Hitler’s playbook!
"Firstly, again, backpaddling and ignoring my actual argument. Never said more people emigrated :P

Secondly, I already did. At several times. On the other Hand, I would love some proof from you for a change, considering you are the one making the assertions here.

If you want a recap:

- Capitalist countries extort, invade, plunder, sanction, colonialise and imperialise other countries. This will make themselves richer, while others poorer. This is a fact. Or are you just gonna ignore away all the damage centuries of colonialization did?

- Socialist countries, on average, have a statistically higher Quality of Life and Economies than their capitalist counterparts when actually compared under equal development. (And those don't even include factors outside of equal development that make it drastically harder for socialist countries, such as more invasions, sanctions etc.). Same development is hereby important, due to the simple fact that the majority of countries that went for socialism, were already poor to begin with. Comparing poor vs rich countries on the premise of ""socialism vs capitalism"" is just ingenuine.

- prior-socialist countries, again on average, have a worse economical and quality of life development after Reforming to capitalism. This is even true by now.

- The majority of people who lived in prior-socialist countries, want a return of socialism.

Again. Your original Statement all hinges on one Single argument. That being, the concept of socialism, when applied, inheritly makes countries poorer on a global basis (or poorer than when using capitalism). I disproved this stance, thoroughly, I hope."
"1- I never agreed on this. You’re asserting definitions I don’t agree with. Capitalism does not imply extortion, invasion, plundering, and sanctioning by default. That’s not what capitalism is. Centuries of colonialization #1 is not an economic system (USSR and China is an imperial power by that logic) and #2 doesn’t Inherently imply damage and destruction. 

2- socialist countries on average have a higher quality of life. Lol prove this 

3- hmm nope. You’re asserting bs with no facts and numbers. 

Also, I argued that socialism makes countries WORSE in every way. Be it freedom, economy, food, media, art, you name it. I don’t give a fuck that Russia went to space when millions were murdered to get there."
"1. How does the definition matter here, if those are things that clearly happened? What, are they now not colonial powers because you said so? Having colonies made them rich, and the exploited ones poor. That's a fact. You can't just deny this without giving any credential argument

2. Official World Bank data? You can just cross-reference them. If you want a paper on that, which comprises that Information specifically for USSR countries, then [here you go](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646771/pdf/amjph00269-0055.pdf)

3. This is just the same point as 2, unless you want to specify something else"
"Because they didn’t clearly happen. 

2- it only measured health and education. Go figure 

3- yeah all your arguments are assertions which presuppose like largeeeee swaths of information in which you just keep contradicting yourself lol. It’s kinda pathetic to anyone with a high IQ but I’ll break it down for you. 

You argue that nobody moves to socialist countries because they’re poor and they want to be in the richer countries. Then you argue that socialist countries actually have better qualities of life. You can’t have both my dude. My point remains, if the quality of life is better then fuckin GO and leave the capitalist countries to the people who like it"
"Oh wow. Colonialization denial is a new one... But what can I expect from somebody who forgot slavery existed... ""high IQ"", Jesus Christ...

2. Correct. The paper goes over education, healthcare (and safety in regards to life expectency) as well as nutritional values (aka. Less starvation). So, you know: basic human needs that should be covered? I am not sure what argument you are trying to make here by saying ""so what, they just had better basic living standards"". Those things are positive??

Other points to mention are also the inclusion of free housing (aka. Basically zero homelessness) and better employment rates, that haven't been covered in this specific paper. You have yet to give an argument how those are bad things or how other points would make them worse than capitalist countries with equal development.

3. Oh no... I am actually giving stats to back up my information... How horrible... This is supposed to be a bad thing?

4. You seem to misunderstand the point. The argument is not ""socialist countries are better off on average than capitalist countries"", as again, this completly undermines any historic context. But rather, the argument is a more nuanced one, being ""socialist countries are better off on average than their capitalist counterparts"", aka. Countries with equal development. Again, the point here is to not compare a country that was barely keeping alive and a literal slave state just 2 months ago, to a country such as the UK that has imperialised and plundered dozens of other countries for centuries. 

This is like the 5th time I had to re-clarify this point. If you can't handle historic context or proper scientific Analysis, then this argument is pointless."
"I never denied colonization. I also never denied slavery. I deny that capitalist countries “exploit invade plunder sanction etc” as I said before, your definitions and arguments presuppose a lot of things that are controversial and not everyone agrees on. 

2- because most socialist dictators pour all their resources into things that yield “numbers” such as education, and healthcare. Very basic things. They don’t care about anything else lol. They centrally plan economies which result in all types of inefficiencies. 

Your stats are very subjective as I can provide stats that counter them. Not your cherry picked study with false conclusions and presupposed definitions. 

AGAIN, as I keep saying, I’m not ignoring any historical context but you’re presupposing WAY TOO MUCH. Does that ever ring a bell in your mind or do you just remain ignorant to keep forcing your point home? You cannot argue for A by asserting things that I haven’t agreed with. I don’t agree that socialist nations are better off than their capitalist counterparts “equal development”. Instead of getting me to agree you are claiming I’m arguing a fallacy because you presuppose that A and B and C are already established in your logical proof. Nuance doesn’t fuckin matter when my argument doesn’t need to presuppose anything. Communists advocating for communism but RARELY if not NEVER moving to communist nations is very telling. Your counter argument that it’s because capitalist countries plundered other ones. That’s a non sequitur. Address the actual problem rather than creating an easy straw man. Why do communists not live in communist countries? The basic needs are met right? It’s because the quality of life is WORSE right? We can argue this but u cannot move goalposts and contradict yourself by saying “it’s cuz socialist nations are exploited so no one wants to be there, but actually the quality of life is better than capitalist countries” like address the problem dude."
Anything that you want to do that is productive and fulfilling is a good EC
"This place is in Boston but it’s the jam! I heard from their head plastic surgeon (Dr. Singhal) who spoke at the lymphedema conference this year, and WOW. Incredible standard of care, start to finish. What they’re doing and how they’re doing it is cutting edge.

"Check out your local NCI Cancer Center(s). Not all of them will have a surgeon who does the surgery, but they are likely to off some suggestions."
I’m in Florida but had the VLNT surgery last October and.. it didn’t really produce any results. It’s tough to say bc I’ve been militant about pumping and wrapping (even tho was told I wouldn’t have to) so my feet/ankles/calves are down slightly but will go back to their usual degree of swollen if I don’t. I’m completely disappointed and can’t help but feel lied to by the medical community. Seems so money-driven. I’m left with scars and debt. I know another person who posts about lymphedema on Reddit who had the same (read: no) results but when I research the procedure it appears to have great success. Just my experience.
"Know it’s a hike but my surgery was done at Beth Israel in Boston and very worth it, AMAZING team.  But I’m only in Newport RI so just 2hrs. I’d say check out the LE&RN website for NY !!"
"No, but glad to know you’re here. I’m in Jersey. Is this an oral or topical or IV med? So glad to hear there is something"
It’s an inspiration listening to you all. Did you manage to get insurance coverage for any of this?
"This facility is excellent, but if you're dealing with lymphedema and have a relatively high BMI or are dealing with secondary illness, you may not qualify for surgical options. I'm actively working to lose weight to meet their criteria. While I'm not extremely overweight, I'm currently outside their preferred range. The next steps, after achieving weight loss and ensuring I'm in remission, involve further testing to potentially qualify for liposuction and then for LVA or similar procedures.

Additionally, they are extremely busy. It took nearly a year to secure my initial consultation, and it was disheartening to learn that my BMI did not meet their requirements. My weight gain was significantly influenced by chemotherapy and steroids, and it's believed that the chemotherapy and cancer triggered my lymphedema, which limited my activity levels.

I wanted to share my experience to highlight that qualifying is not straightforward, and not everyone will meet the criteria. Prepare as well as you can, and I wish you the best in your journey."
Its good to hear that Beth Israel is doing some good things! Thank you so much - did you have the procedure done there?
Dr Singhal did my debulking surgery and his team is on point!!
"Dr Singhal was the beginning of LE&RN thankfully for us, I’m happy to have been his patient."
That is helpful thank you!!
"I'm sorry to hear that your experience hasn't been as successful as you hoped that is really frustrating. Oh the medical community somehow so money driven while also being so stingy with even covering surgeries. Is it possible for you since its been less than a year that it may just need more time to compensate/stabilize? Not to say you haven't already thought about that and even still not seeing the results you want or were told you should have can be so disheartening. 

I find myself sometimes oscillating back and forth - I don't have pain so if I can manage better with MLD + better compression, maybe I should just try that instead of surgery. But when I see the surgical results (of the most successful ones) of course I get excited and feel like I should go that route. 

The consultations I've had have told me that based on my stage (stage 2) I'd need the lipo first because the others (VLNT, LVA) on their own wouldn't be as successful. But I'm trying CDT again this year (found out from a new therapist that the old one didn't do it nearly as well as they could've based on my description), so for the sake of money, body, recovery I'll be trying that first! 

Would you mind letting me know where in FL you got it done? The place I have had the consultation with was in FL so I'm curious to see if its the same place."
"Actually I looked at train tickets (I'm a bit tired of flying at this point with the trial lol) and its not too bad/far! My main concern was if I could travel back to NY after the surgery by train vs. have to stay in Boston for a few weeks post op.

Did you stay in Boston post surgery post op? And other than reduction (which of course is the main goal so I'm so glad it sounds like the surgery went well), did you find your need for compression has changed/lessened?"
"Its an oral medication! The have slowly increased my dose overtime (to make sure my liver in particular was tolerating it), so now I'm up to 7 days/week. 

Message me if you'd like more details - they are moving into the next phase which hopefully either gets pushed to the FDA sooner or will have more trial spots across the country (so people can be treated but not have to shoulder the financial burden of going to CA every 3 months)."
"Thank you - I want so badly for all of us to get more relief! Insurance covered everything in the trial in terms of the visits (with a $30 copay for each visit for me) but I had to pay for my flights and lodgings (about $500 per trip where I would fly in the morning before the appt, have the appt the next day and then fly out that night). 

Thats why I'm hoping they approve the next phase with more clinics so folks don't have to shoulder that travel burden (I am by no means wealthy of funds, I just saved $100 each paycheck and dipped a bit into savings and made it work - so it can be done!)"
"You’re right, having to get yourself to a good surgery point with blood and water flow is VERY important with any lymphedema surgery. A close friend of mine had arm and she was on too many medications that 4yrs later she is only being considered for surgery if she can come off some😔(Cancer steroid meds mostly)."
"Thank you for this note - its a good point for qualifications and where that might be more stringent. I think I'd be ok BMI wise, but its good to know as well to start the process ASAP because it sounds like it can be at least 2 years out from finding the place/consulting and the actual surgery."
Yeah?! Cool! I’d love to hear more about your experience. I’m a pretty new lymphedema therapist and I have yet to work on tissue that has had this done. I don’t know what it feels like. Mind if I DM you with a couple questions?
"That’s so cool! He seemed kind and curious! My favorite kind of doctor. 

He showed a video clip of surgery (and lymph successfully flowing through a new established channel) during his presentation and I may have been on the edge of my seat. Haha"
"Thank you for your kind response. Yes, it is possible I haven’t waited long enough. But surely I’d see some change..? I got it done at Advent Health in Orlando. 
That’s crazy because I am stage 3 and was told to get the VLNT and *then* a possible lipo."
"Compressions got smaller BUT very important I still have to wear them😕 It is much more comfortable & confident now though! Supposed to wear doubles but my leg has been doing so good with just one thankfully. I can also go about 2-3 days without wearing any and still be good🙌🏼

Yeah the train & flights are not cheap & very annoying, so frequently. My post op check up was a month out & then were about every 3months, if I remember correctly. And it was 3 days(best outcome) in hospital for debulking surgery. 
Dr Singhal & his team are AMAZING. 
Not sure about your insurance, I’m very lucky with mine thankfully, but getting compressions at such a smaller size/level is harder with $0 spent😔

I would still get onto LE&RN’s website and see who their options are for NY, might find surgeon near you or somebody that will pay for all travel! 

Lymphedema is annoying honestly lol I’ve had a lot medically but lymphin is still my most hated haha"
"Well heres hoping time will offer you a beautiful surprise of more progress! 

Thats so wild - I can't say that I know the full complexity of the lymphatics but based on all the research I've done it seems like it would make the most sense to start by removing the solids that aren't going anywhere otherwise, letting the body heal and then doing a VLNT or LVA as a corrective measure. I'm still crossing my fingers for you that it will lessen with more time but that is a really interesting choice they made. 

I realize sympathize with your frustration though - not that it is at all as taxing as surgery but when I went for CDT for the first time (and only time thus far), they didn't wrap me. Like huh? I knew something was wrong/this wasn't the complete therapy (they had me do exercises, used a pump and massage), but I didn't know enough at the time to ask more. The crazy part is that they still charged my insurance for the wraps! So that money gone and while the medicine I'm on has helped with improvement, I never got the gold standard to start me off at a better place. 

Here is to us both having some better luck and providers moving forward!"
Sounds like it was worth it though! Do you mind me asking what stage you were in?
"Late stage unfortunately, had my hips replaced (separately) in 2014 and lymphedema started creeping up in 2017 but not noticed until 2019.. then COVID hit and my surgery was scheduled for 2020, had to wait until 2022 to get it. With COVID and then my vitals were never on point it just delayed it BUT end result worked out(for me). Message me and I’ll send you photos of it all if you want! Along with references & dirty details LOL"
I'm so glad it worked out for you even through what sounds like many years of back and forth! I will definitely message thank you!
"I'm not sure I understand your post, but that NY Times' piece ""Are We Talking Too Much About Mental Health?"" is really interesting. Thanks for sharing."

Dam that’s some old news but what’s even worse is that no one cared when the news was released
You know what’s the most confusing thing about this to me is that there is never coverage on the patent situation. The base patent rights should be being talked about and arguments were heard in appeals court this week. The valuation of this company is a real head scratcher given the current patent rights.

"I know someone who got accepted into ST3 and a PhD programme the same year - caused a huge issue because the deanery insisted they have at least one ARCP without concerns before they would consider allowing an OOPR (after initially saying it would be fine). They had to pass on a fully funded PhD to keep their training number. 
I'd check the gold guide in case this is different between deaneries but I suspect not."
"""3.156 OOP will not normally be agreed until a trainee has been in a training programme for at least one year of specialty training (unless at the time of appointment, deferral of the start of the programme has been agreed for leave on statutory grounds).

It sounds like what you are suggesting probably wouldn't be possible. You could approach the TPD about it if you get an ST offer and see what they say about it."
I did this; they weren't thrilled about it but let me do it anyway
"I don’t have an answer to your question. 
But the way I see it, if it’s a fully funded phd, it will increase your chances of getting the ST when you finally afterwards. 
I’m not sure how phd funding works, but could you get it next year if you don’t want to give up your HST NTN?"
Well done! How much time did you have to defer training? 2/3 years?
3 years- fully funded PhD like yours!
That's amazing congrats! There is hope ⭐️
"I’m interested in this. Saline should have a more neutral pH and be more comfortable. This is very obvious in other clinical procedures (pH and temperature of anesthetic matters).
15 is a really low number for clinical relevance outside of showing it should be research more. 
It’s really easy to reconstitute 2 bottles and check for yourself. 
I’ve seen people here say both works better. 
The innotox I use burns for sure. I assumed it is the bacteria static nature doing it. Maybe this is wrong but I have not done a side by side yet."
"Is there a place to even buy bac stat saline?  A couple of years ago, I had no problems finding it, and now a prescription is required and bacteriostatic water seems to be the only option if we want to reconstitute with something that is preserved."
"
*
I'm getting ready to reconstitute Nabota. I used the green bac saline last time & it burned like crazy. The blue is the solution the company sent with it & pink is bac water. Which one can I use that won't burn?? Tia!"
Just did Botox training today. They mentioned this!
"I have used mostly saline 0.9 and no difference .of course I used some numbing cream ,very lightly, prior"
"You’re right. PH is extremely important! I have never seen so many comments suggesting that Innotox burns/stings as I have recently. Thanks for your feedback. Would you be willing to try a different toxin to avoid the sting associated with Innotox? Just to clarity, it seems not everyone experiences the sting of Innotox, however, it does seem to be very common however."
it’s not only because of the PH. saline solution is an  isotonic solution with 0.9 nacl concentration that mimics the cell plasma in human body. distilled  water for injection contains nothing . the body recognizes it as a foreign substance and sends a pain response to the brain.
"lol don’t do BAC water. I’ve done it before and when I tell you it burns like lava… I mean it.

I’m inquiring with some of my vendors right now to see if someone will be able to carry it. Would be nice to have easy access to it through a reputable company."
Oh nice! Did they say Bac Saline was less painful?Thanks for sharing.
Opinions are all over the place but I was thinking of Nabota next. I’m not worried abt reconstitution. What do you suggest?
"Same. Never, ever again. It was torture."
It’s awful!!!!
Yes they did!
"If you’re not aware, it’s easy to assume BAC water and BAC saline are the same. You and I both not lol that’s far from the case."
I didn't know the difference.  I know the companies typically include or sell bacteriostatic water.  I did now see it was bacteriostatic saline and not bacteriostatic water.  BAC water is what they sell and you are saying not to use it?
Good to know. I’ve been making this mistake!
I will never use water again. I thought I was dying and I have a pretty high pain tolerance. I didn’t even complete my 11s before abandoning it. I used it for microneedling and it was fine. But injections? No way.

"I'm sorry to say, that nothing has helped mine. I did Tepezza and steroid infusions and that didn't work. I had surgery and that worked for 3 months and the double vision came back. My u derstandong is that surgery won't help unless the Thyroid Eye Disease is either in remission or at least stable. 
Good luck!"
"I had 6 infusions of solumedrol off 500mcg and 6 infusions of 250mcg and it kinda did help tbh, but im scared that they will come back out. I already had my thyroid fully removed but the eyes can still continue to bulge but yeah"
"Just to provide some positivity, I believe it can get better on its own when thyroid hormone and antibodies are stable. If it doesn’t which is possible that’s when ODS is a viable option for the appearance aspect and possibly for the vision aspect as well. Although people do have worsening double visions sometimes, people tend to see improvement as well. When it comes to Tepezza from what I hear is that it works but can also can have some pretty severe side effects."
"Surgery doesn’t cure proptosis, it just creates more space around the eyes so it doesn’t add pressure to the optic nerve. Or it helps with the aesthetics."
No.
Same I've been stuck with my bulging eyes for 4 years already. I haven't tried the surgery but my doctor is suggesting it after 6 months. Idk if this is a good idea still.
Orbital decompression most definitely will reduce proptosis. In terms of a it being a “cure” yeah it’s not a cure but it can provide symmetry with your eyes and reduce that bulging look. The better the surgeon the better the outcome. If your antibodies are low and TED is in the inactive phase as well as thyroid hormone being normal and healthy this surgery is a viable option. Double vision dosent always happen in everyone’s case either it varies.
As Usual - Great Post UWS - We WILL win this - Standing By Tightlines
"Hello UWS, excellent thought out post. I really appreciate you taking the time.!

I believe that the cost of a lab that is published is sort of like the WAC price of pharmaceuticals, that meaning those rates are extremely negotiable and if you have a plan, it’s greatly reduced.  For example, if I were to go and get labs done on my dime, I would pay hundreds of dollars for a simple lab test, but having benefits that have been negotiated rates, those prices are substantially lower.  I’m hoping this is the case with our clinical trials, we will have negotiated contract rates well below the published price., but that’s just my guess, and my hope!

I believe it is difficult to wait, but understand the process and what is unfolding in front of us!


I, like most longs , continue accumulate with  these low prices and I believe the worse is behind and the future looks extremely bright!

Patience to all longs. Still here. Always.
"Hey Brother, great seeing you.

For #1, do you think it is still feasible that the first patient be enrolled by late June?

For #2, I was thinking the CRO would be the most expensive part.  Those costs for the labs are likely negotiated with by the paying insurance company and are probably less than half of the maximum listed.  Still, it's a hell of a lot of money for blood work.  

For #3, [On PASC, Long COVID, Long Haulers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016344532400080X)

#4, Merck may not be involved, especially, if CytoDyn is paying.  Antonio Migliarese 

>*""However, could we perform some sort of preclinical trial combination therapy with another drug, such as Madrigal or one of the other players out there that's further ahead than us in the game? And so I think what we're getting at is identifying these preclinical studies, which are significantly cheaper in the $200,000 to $300,000 range could lead to some potential partnerships and credibility with some of the other larger pharmas, which could then help propel us within these other spaces with well-investing limited funds. So just saying that, I think help people understand as we've been going through this clinical hold process and the process that we're in the middle of right now is coming up with a judicious plan, which we think we can utilize the least amount of capital to create the greatest number of catalysts for the company, which we're very much in need of as we've been working through the hold."".*

"Excellent, UWS, thank you.  Putting things in that perspective helps keep my impatience in check. I've only been long for around 3 years and have a pretty decent cost basis from accumulating.  I can only imagine what a pull this is for people who got in earlier in the story. Hang in there, longs!"
"UWS...A terrific outline of where We are at the moment...with emphasis on ""don't get sore...buy some more""...while  at the back of my mind.... I remember ""negotiated settlement"""
Word from the back channels is the trial is estimated at $9-10 million.
"Thank you sir, always a pleasure to hear from you. Great reverse engineering for those cost estimates."
We are all together my brother
That idea of a contract price with a lab that performs the assays makes total sense. I hope that is something that is being worked on! Thank you Professional Art
Wow! You gotta shop around for a good deal with the Interleukin test!
Love it jsinvest! We stand together with a boat load of other Longs!
"I may not have estimated the CRO part with a lot of thought. Somebody has to aggregate all of the labs, input the results and identify trends and calculate p values. Some of that is performed by a biostatistics person and at one point we had a full time biostatistician (not sure anymore)."
I’m right there with you “All in for the win”
Perfectly stated my brother! Dr. JL is doing all the right things
"That is a great reminder Expensive Tea! I hope that just pops soon. I have the arbitration trial in my head as November, but as you stated “settlement” can happen anytime!!"
Always wondered who is your back channels? But that being said; it all depends on what array of biomarkers they want to study and how much it costs to perform the associated biomarker assays. My estimate is really rough and the Interleukin test estimate from my physician provided a clue that I was on the low end of the spectrum. Your back channels could be right on this one.
