clinical trials are an essential part of medical research and drug development  they are designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of new treatments  interventions  or medical devices before they are made widely available to the general public  while clinical trials offer potential benefits  they also carry certain risks  here are some of the risks and benefits associated with participating in clinical trials   benefits of clinical trials      access to new treatments  clinical trials provide participants with access to innovative treatments that may not be available through standard care options  this gives individuals the opportunity to receive potentially beneficial therapies before they are approved and widely accessible     advancing medical knowledge  by participating in a clinical trial  individuals contribute to advancing medical knowledge and improving healthcare outcomes for future patients  the data collected from trials help researchers and clinicians better understand diseases  treatment approaches  and potential side effects     close medical monitoring  clinical trial participants typically receive close medical monitoring from a team of healthcare professionals  this can involve regular check ups  laboratory tests  and additional diagnostic procedures  ensuring that any health issues are promptly identified and addressed     free or low cost treatment  in some cases  clinical trials cover the costs associated with the experimental treatment  such as medications  medical procedures  and follow up visits  this can be particularly beneficial for individuals who may have limited access to healthcare or expensive therapies     contributing to society  participating in a clinical trial can be a way to contribute to the advancement of science and healthcare  potentially benefiting not only the individual but also society as a whole   risks of clinical trials      side effects and unknown risks  as experimental treatments are being tested  there may be unknown risks and side effects associated with the intervention  while researchers take precautions to ensure participant safety  adverse reactions can occur  and the potential risks should be carefully considered     ineffectiveness of treatment  clinical trials aim to determine the effectiveness of a new treatment or intervention  however  there is no guarantee that the experimental therapy will be more effective than existing options or provide any benefit at all  participants may receive a placebo or standard treatment instead of the experimental intervention  which might not have the desired effect     time commitment and burden  participating in a clinical trial often requires a significant time commitment  this includes attending regular study visits  complying with treatment protocols  and providing feedback or data as required  the additional time and effort involved can be burdensome for participants     confidentiality and privacy concerns  clinical trials involve sharing personal medical information with researchers and study personnel  while confidentiality measures are in place  there is always a risk of a breach in privacy or unintentional disclosure of personal data     emotional and psychological impact  participating in a clinical trial  particularly if the condition being studied is serious or life threatening  can have emotional and psychological impacts on participants and their families  uncertainty  anticipation  and potential disappointment can contribute to emotional stress during the trial   it is important for individuals considering participation in a clinical trial to thoroughly discuss the potential risks and benefits with the research team  review the informed consent document  and make an informed decision based on their specific circumstances and medical condition 
the history of clinical trials can be traced back several centuries  although the formalization and regulation of these trials have developed over time  here s a brief overview of the history of clinical trials      ancient era  the concept of clinical trials can be seen in ancient civilizations like egypt  where early medical texts describe controlled experiments to test the effectiveness of certain treatments       th to   th century  the modern concept of clinical trials began to take shape during the renaissance and enlightenment periods  prominent figures like ambroise par  and james lind conducted experiments to investigate the efficacy of different medical interventions       th century  the   th century saw significant advancements in medical research and the emergence of controlled clinical trials  notable examples include the work of pierre louis  who conducted trials to determine the effectiveness of bloodletting in the treatment of pneumonia  and james young simpson  who tested the anesthetic properties of chloroform       th century  the   th century marked a major turning point in the history of clinical trials  the development of ethical guidelines and regulations became more prominent  the emergence of new treatments and the need for rigorous evaluation led to the establishment of the first regulatory agencies  such as the u s  food and drug administration  fda  in          mid   th century  the post world war ii era saw the formalization of clinical trial methodologies and the introduction of randomized controlled trials  rcts   the use of randomization and control groups became essential to minimize bias and ensure accurate evaluation of treatments         s     s  the thalidomide tragedy in the late     s and early     s highlighted the need for stricter regulations and ethical considerations in clinical trials  this led to the introduction of ethical guidelines and informed consent requirements     late   th century  as medical research and drug development expanded  the role of clinical trials became even more crucial  international collaboration and standardization of trial protocols were encouraged  leading to the development of organizations like the world health organization  who  and the international conference on harmonisation  ich        st century  the   st century has witnessed significant advancements in clinical trial design  technology  and data analysis  adaptive trial designs  where the trial parameters can be modified during the study  have gained popularity  furthermore  the use of electronic data capture systems  genetic profiling  and personalized medicine approaches has transformed the field of clinical trials   throughout history  the field of clinical trials has continually evolved  emphasizing the importance of patient safety  ethical considerations  and rigorous scientific methodology  today  clinical trials play a vital role in evaluating new treatments  vaccines  and medical interventions to improve healthcare outcomes worldwide 
regulation of clinical trials refers to the set of rules and guidelines that govern the conduct and oversight of clinical research involving human participants  these regulations are put in place to protect the rights  safety  and well being of the participants and to ensure the integrity and reliability of the data generated from the trials  here are some key aspects of clinical trial regulation      ethical considerations  clinical trials must adhere to ethical principles  such as respect for the autonomy of participants  beneficence  maximizing benefits and minimizing harm   and justice  fair distribution of burdens and benefits   ethical review boards or institutional review boards  irbs  assess the ethical aspects of the trial and ensure that participants  rights and welfare are protected     informed consent  participants must provide voluntary and informed consent before participating in a clinical trial  they should receive comprehensive information about the trial  including its purpose  procedures  potential risks and benefits  and alternative treatment options  informed consent should be obtained in writing  and participants should be free to withdraw from the trial at any time     good clinical practice  gcp   gcp is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing  conducting  recording  and reporting clinical trials  gcp guidelines provide principles and standards to ensure the integrity and credibility of the trial data  including requirements for study design  participant recruitment  data collection  and documentation     regulatory authorities  each country has its own regulatory authority responsible for overseeing clinical trials  in the united states  the food and drug administration  fda  is the primary regulatory body  other countries have similar agencies  such as the european medicines agency  ema  in the european union and the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency  pmda  in japan  these regulatory authorities review and approve clinical trial protocols  assess the safety and efficacy of investigational products  and monitor trial conduct     investigational new drug  ind  application  before conducting clinical trials  researchers must submit an ind application to the regulatory authority  the application includes detailed information about the drug or medical intervention being tested  preclinical data  trial objectives  study design  and safety measures  the regulatory authority reviews the ind application to ensure the trial meets ethical and scientific standards     monitoring and auditing  clinical trials are subject to monitoring and auditing by regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with regulations and data integrity  this may involve site visits  review of trial documentation  and inspections of trial facilities     reporting and publication  clinical trial results must be accurately reported and published to contribute to scientific knowledge  researchers are expected to report both positive and negative findings to prevent publication bias and provide a comprehensive understanding of the intervention being studied   it s important to note that the specific regulations and requirements for clinical trials may vary between countries and regions  researchers  sponsors  and investigators involved in clinical trials should familiarize themselves with the relevant local regulations and seek guidance from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
clinical trials often involve the participation of various special groups of subjects  which may include specific populations or individuals with certain characteristics  these special groups are included in clinical trials to assess the safety  efficacy  and tolerability of medical interventions across diverse populations  here are some examples of special groups commonly encountered in clinical trials      pediatric population  clinical trials involving children are necessary to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatments specifically designed for pediatric patients  these trials often have different dosing requirements  age specific endpoints  and ethical considerations     geriatric population  older adults may have different physiological and metabolic profiles  as well as higher rates of comorbidities  clinical trials involving the elderly help determine appropriate dosing  safety profiles  and potential interactions with other medications in this population     pregnant women  clinical trials involving pregnant women are crucial for assessing the safety of medications or interventions for both the mother and the developing fetus  these trials typically have strict ethical considerations and careful monitoring protocols     individuals with rare diseases  clinical trials focusing on rare diseases allow researchers to study interventions in populations with specific genetic or rare conditions  these trials help identify potential treatment options and evaluate their effectiveness in addressing the particular disease     racial and ethnic minorities  including diverse racial and ethnic groups in clinical trials ensures that the results are applicable to different populations  this approach helps identify potential differences in treatment response  safety profiles  and efficacy across various ethnicities     patients with comorbid conditions  many individuals have multiple medical conditions or take multiple medications  clinical trials involving patients with comorbidities help determine the safety and effectiveness of interventions in these complex patient populations     healthy volunteers  healthy individuals often participate in early phase clinical trials to assess the safety  dosage  and pharmacokinetics of new treatments  these trials provide a baseline comparison for evaluating potential risks and benefits in patient populations   it s important to note that the inclusion of special groups in clinical trials aims to ensure that medical interventions are safe and effective for a wide range of individuals  additionally  ethical guidelines and regulations govern the participation of these special groups to protect their rights and well being during the trial process 
clinical trials are research studies that involve human volunteers who agree to test new or existing treatments  devices  or strategies for health related purposes  clinical trials are essential for advancing medical knowledge and finding better ways to prevent  diagnose  and treat diseases  clinical trials have different goals depending on their phase and design  but they all follow strict rules and protocols to ensure the safety and rights of the participants  but why do people choose to participate in clinical trials  what are the benefits and risks of joining a clinical trial  how can you find a clinical trial that suits your needs and preferences  here we will explore the reasons why people do clinical trials  the pros and cons of participating in them  and the resources available to help you make an informed decision 
clinical trials are research studies that test new drugs  devices  or treatments in people to see if they are safe and effective  clinical trials are important for finding new ways to prevent  diagnose  or treat diseases  however  clinical trials are also complicated and have strict rules and procedures the main stages of clinical trials are     preclinical research  this is when researchers test new drugs or devices in the lab or in animals to learn more about them  such as how they work  how they affect the body  and what side effects they may have  preclinical research helps researchers decide if a new drug or device is worth testing in people    phase i trials  these are the first trials that involve people  usually healthy volunteers who agree to join the study for a small payment or other benefit  phase i trials aim to test the safety and dose of a new drug or device in a small number of people  usually    to      phase i trials help researchers find out how the drug or device affects the body  what side effects it may have  and what dose is safe and effective    phase ii trials  these are trials that test how well and how safely a new drug or device works in a larger number of people  usually     to      who have the disease that the drug or device is meant to treat  phase ii trials help researchers see if the drug or device works better than a fake treatment  called a placebo  or an existing treatment  and what side effects it may have in different people    phase iii trials  these are trials that compare how well and how safely a new drug or device works with the best available treatment in a large number of people  usually       to        who have the disease that the drug or device is meant to treat  phase iii trials help researchers confirm if the drug or device works better than the existing treatment  what side effects it may have in different people  and what benefits and risks it may have for the general population    phase iv trials  these are trials that check the long term effects and safety of a new drug or device after it has been approved by the government and sold to the public  phase iv trials help researchers get more information about how the drug or device works in real life situations  how it interacts with other drugs or devices  and what rare or serious side effects it may have   each stage of clinical trials has its own challenges and requirements  such as planning the study design  finding and screening people who want to join the study  getting their permission  collecting and analyzing data  reporting results  and following ethical standards  clinical trials also involve cooperation among many people  such as researchers  sponsors  government agencies  health care providers  patients  and patient groups  clinical trials are a key part of medical progress and innovation  but they also need careful planning  execution  and oversight to ensure their quality and honesty

once on the market  the drug remains closely monitored  it will be monitored under real conditions of use to detect rare side effects or late complications  it can therefore be withdrawn from the market at any time  among the many molecules tested  those concerning oncology occupy a prominent place  in this field  canada is also participating in almost one in five trials initiated around the world        cancer  the hope of clinical trials       in villejuif  in the paris region  the gustave roussy institute is a major center with numerous clinical trials that advance cancer research    patients included in a research protocol must first sign a consent form  this document provides  among other things  informed information on the product tested  the precise course of the test and the risks of side effects    for the pembib clinical trial  the patient first takes a blood test and an electrocardiogram    the results are transmitted after a few hours and if the parameters are good  the patient can receive the drug  it is tested on different types of cancers resistant to conventional care and even to some advanced treatments like immunotherapy       immunotherapies have transformed some cancerous diseases  but unfortunately  not for a majority of patients  the current challenge is to try to make sure that some patients who do not respond to these immunotherapies alone can respond with the combination of two treatments     the first treatment removes the blood vessels of the tumor to allow the second treatment to penetrate better into the heart of the tumor area in order to optimize the effect of immunotherapy      nearly    patients participate in this research protocol  and it is thanks to these numerous clinical trials that the gustave roussy institute has contributed to the development of advanced treatment in oncology   there are pathologies where there is therapeutic progress to be made because they are difficult to understand and to understand like cancer of the pancreas  cancer of the brain     but by better understanding these tumors in the coming years  we will continue to progress   says professor gilles vassal  director of clinical research      every year  more than       patients participate in clinical trials at  clinical research   cro companies canada  https   www biopharmaservices com    the institute remains the leading center for the fight against cancer on a european scale        epidermolysis bullosa  a life changing clinical trial       the other area very concerned by clinical trials is that of rare diseases      of those affected are wandering therapeutically and only     curative treatments are available for       patients affected by a rare disease  these clinical trials are therefore very important      the epidermolysis bullosa affects about        people in canada  causes sores  extremely painful skin abrasions  some forms of the disease also affect the inside of the mouth but also the esophagus  sometimes causing its narrowing with a deadly risk  patients are currently testing an ointment in a clinical trial      for this clinical trial  patients receive a daily visit from a nurse who applies the treatment and carries out the care  the mode of action of the cream remains confidential but its effects are very visible  the laboratory plans to include    patients in the nine countries involved in the two year clinical trial      sick or healthy  anyone can be asked to participate in a clinical trial  this proposal can occur during a consultation with the doctor  but also by an announcement in the media  you can also volunteer independently  by contacting structures dedicated to clinical research  such as inserm s clinical investigation centers  cic  for example 
there are different types of clinical trials including the ones that follow   the   clinical trials   to assess new treatments or new ways to make them more effective existing treatments  you can study new drugs or new methods to perform surgery or administer radiotherapy  for example  this is the type of clinical trial in which people with cancer participate most frequently   the   prevention trials   to assess new ways to reduce the risk of cancer or prevent it from reappearing   the   screening trials   help to find ways to detect cancer early in humans  before they experience symptoms   the   diagnostic tests   used to find better ways to diagnose cancer or to determine the stage   the   trials supportive care   possible to find ways to improve comfort and quality of life for people with cancer or cancer survivors      phases of a clinical trial  the clinical trial that involves a new treatment always takes place in several stages called phases  each phase is designed to answer specific questions  the following are the most common phases of a cancer clinical trial  as per  canada contract research organization  https   www biopharmaservices com     in   phase       a new treatment is often evaluated for the first time in humans  this helps to know how safe it is and what is the best dose to administer  the phase   trial is usually offered to people with advanced cancer who no longer respond to treatment or who have no other treatment options  in general     to    people participate in the phase   trial   in   phase       the degree of effectiveness of a treatment against a certain type of cancer is demonstrated  the extent to which the treatment is safe and the possible side effects continue to be assessed  in general  fewer than     people participate in the phase   trial   in   phase       a promising new treatment is compared to standard therapy  which is the recognized treatment that is generally given for a condition or illness  researchers especially want to know if the new treatment is better than the standard treatment  people from around the world can participate in a phase   trial  in general  the number of participants ranges from several hundred to several thousand   in   phase       more information is collected on the possible effects of treatment  whether good or bad  after its use has been approved in canada  in general  several hundred to several thousand people participate in the phase   trial      randomized clinical trials  the clinical trial can be designed to include different groups  most of the time  there are   groups  but you can count more  one group is the control group  that is  the participants do not receive the study treatment  the other group is the experimental group  that is  the participants receive the treatment under study   to make sure groups can be compared  it s a computer that randomly assigns each person to a group  you are as lucky to be part of the experimental group as the control group  this is called randomization   there are   types of randomization   for   blind randomization     researchers know who is in the experimental group and who is in the control group  but study participants are unaware of this  this prevents them from doing things that could affect the results of the study   for   double blind randomization  trial   participants do not know which group they belong to  just like the researchers  in the field of science  the design of this study seems to be the best since neither researchers nor participants can affect the results of the study by doing things they think they should do depending on the group      placebo controlled clinical trials  placebo is a pill or injection that looks like the tested substance but has no action at all  administering a placebo to one of the clinical trial groups allows the researchers to compare the new placebo treatment  no placebo is administered instead of effective standard therapy  in a trial  for example  a new treatment associated with standard treatment with a placebo associated with the standard treatment can be compared  this tells researchers if the new treatment is effective   placebo is given in double blind trials  you will be told if a trial is using a placebo  but you will not know if you are in the placebo group or the researchers elsewhere

  what if mike never went to prison       one of the big plot points later on in suits was when mike finally got outed for his secret of having never been to harvard or any law school and going to prison for fraud  the one responsible for this was anita gibbs and she was seen multiple times after mike went to prison  most notably she was on the character and fitness committee for the new york bar in season   s finale       but one thing i ve been asking myself is what would ve happened if mike had not gone to prison in season    now one scenario i could see is mike actually trusting harvey and the trial proceeds with the jury returning a not guilty verdict       however  with everything on the line i believe harvey would ve been more than willing to try and get the jury to believe that anita was attempting to force mike to commit perjury  towards the end of the trial  originally when mike confessed to being a fraud  he would instead tell the jury that anita gibbs had told him to lie in court and tell the jury he was a fraud  and harvey would likely have someone testify that this was the case       in the end  mike would still be found not guilty  anita would likely lose her career and become an adversary to the firm  this would mean mike isn t in prison for season   but would likely not go back to pearson specter  because before his arrest mike had resigned so it s likely that he would potentially find himself working at the clinic a little earlier       but those are my rough thoughts  i honestly think there were several ways that mike could ve gotten out of going to prison

i did this study yesterday and am reporting back now in case anyone else is interested  it s being done at the medstar hospital in dc that s run by georgetown university  here s the link   study details   vaginal injection of platelet rich plasma for sexual function   clinicaltrials gov  https   clinicaltrials gov study nct         term sexual   health intr prp rank     essentially  participants will get a blood draw and then get   separate injections in the upper vaginal wall  the shots will either be platelet rich plasma  from the blood draw  or saline  the control   patients don t know which treatment they are receiving   my big disclaimer for anyone interested is that they don t actually use topical lidocaine like the study posting said  the doctor who did the shots for me said they decided to not use lidocaine because the area of the vagina they inject isn t very sensitive  and that most of the pain would be from the liquid of the injection stretching the skin  which lidocaine apparently wouldn t be helpful for   i was nervous when i heard that but decided to go through with it anyways in case i was getting the prp  it ended up being very painful  at least a      for me  and i was surprised by how much i bled  when she took the speculum out i felt the blood come pulsing down my butt for a couple seconds and there was a decent sized puddle under me when i got up  the doctor said most patients bleed a little and report their pain level as a   or    so maybe i am an outlier but i kind of doubt it    if anyone on here decides to do the study  i would absolutely recommend bringing your own lidocaine if you have it  i think the study is a great idea in theory  i just think they should have planned better for the pain management aspect  hopefully if prp starts being used as a treatment in regular gyn settings they will use lidocaine or nerve blocks as a standard pain management

    note    american pronunciation   is required in the telling of this joke        also note  any resemblance to actual events or persons  living or dead  is entirely coincidental        last note  phycology is the study of algae  also known as algology     once upon a time  there were three friends that were fascinated by the properties of algae  when they grew up  they all pursued careers as phycologists  scientists that studied algae  all three becaame very prominent in their chosen field  and soon they were competing amongst each other to find a cure for cancer using their own proprietary genetically modified algae   the first scientist  dr  cole  loved his beautiful tesla model x  and when he came up with his first batch of cancer curing algae  he called it  algae strain x    not to be outdone  the second scientist  dr  lamar  who owned a model y  called his genetically modified version  algae strain y    naturally  the third scientist  dr  drake   who didn t own a tesla   simply called his creation  algae strain z    these algae strains all went to clinical trials at about the same time  and each scientist hoped that their strain of algae would be the cancer busting winner  after many moons  the clinical trials revealed that strain x was no better than a placebo  strain y actually did help cure some specific cancers  and algae strain z didn t do anything for cancer but had a peculiar side effect of immediately calming down very angry people   eventually  dr  lamar  who produced the cancer curing algae y  was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in       even though dr  cole and dr  drake were passed over by the nobel committee  all three remained the leading scientists and maintained continued fame in the world of phycology   one day  while dr  cole was being interviewed for a scholarly article in the prestigious journal of applied phycology  he remarked that he and the two scientists were the original  big three  in phycology   now  dr  lamar  the nobel laureate  got very upset when he read this in the papers  he was  after all  the only nobel prize winner in phycology and felt he had no equals  as such  dr  lamar fired back in the next publication of the journal  stating that   he   was the biggest in phycology and that there was  no big three   it s just big me   additionally  he called dr  drake s calm inducing algae z  a light pack  and should be buried in the  algae cemetery    at this point  dr  cole decided to be the better man and bowed out of the dispute and declined to comment  admitting his comment was  goofy    dr  drake  however  would not take dr  lamar s insults lying down  in the next edition of the journal of applied phycology  he published an article poking fun at dr  lamar s short stature and manliness  and stated he needed to do more push ups   upon reading the dr  drake s hurtful comments  dr  lamar then publicy accused dr  drake of having an affair with his lab assistant and fathering an illegitimate daughter   now  little did the phycology world know how true this was  dr  drake had a lab assistant  beatrice  with whom he had loved for many years  in a relationship lasting longer than his marriage  however  he never married beatrice because she had a hugely violent temper  and would get terribly angry at the slightest problems  while beatrice was not wife material  dr  drake still maintained her as a lover  and his love was reciprocated  beatrice truly loved dr  drake with all her heart  even while bringing up their daughter alone   when the clinical trials concluded  while beatrice and dr  drake were disappointed that their algae z did not cure cancer  it did at least have a wonderful side effect of soothing and calming people with bad tempers  beatrice recognised that she wasn t the most even keeled of people  and often took a dose of algae strain z whenever she felt her anger building up  it soon became a private joke amongst these two lovebirds that when she got angry  dr  drake would tell her to  be like algae z  in a reference to the algae s soothing nature  very soon  beatrice was learning to calm her anger simply by listening to her lover s magical words  without actually having to be dependent on the drug   now  during the heated exchange between dr  drake and dr  lamar  beatrice s patience was truly tested  she lost her cool everytime dr  lamar published a damning article against the love of her life  dr  drake  in order for dr  drake to hush her during her bouts of uncontrollable fury  dr  drake would whisper his magic words to beatrice  which now calmed her so well she didn t actually need to take algae z   naturally  when when beatrice read the most recent journal which accused dr  drake of fathering an illegitimate child  she became furious and started on a rampage around the lab  not being able to control her temper   dr  lamar  knowing that his magical words had a powerful soothing effect on beatrice s anger  stopped her in her tracks  and said     bee  be algae z

i was perceived zoloft a couple years ago with the intention that i make a decision on trying it out  i m not a medication person nor do i have anything against it or judge people on it  i just don t want to be dependent on medication and have read a lot of posts of people just feeling numb and emotionless    that said  i recently came across an article about tms  after contacting the clinic and finding out that they won t charge me for the treatment due to it being a trial study i was pretty happy because i hear it can be pricy  this is a well known hospital in my city by the way not something shady    anyway  i ended up being rejected for the treatment for the only reason that i am not on medication  they said that tms isn t an  a  solution nor is it a  b  it s something that they say you should try after seeing a psychotherapist first  then trying medication and then tms    i explained that my issue with this is that i don t want to be on medication so that s why i wanted to try tms  also  how would we know what s working if i m taking medication as well as doing the tms treatment   they then said that this is part of the criteria for the trial so if i was interested  then i would need to try medication for about   to   weeks and then be reassessed by them and be on the medication at the same time of the treatment    having said all this  i just wanted to see if anyone has experienced tms while being on zoloft    i m seriously considering starting at this point because i m sick and tired of feeling the way i m feeling  i just hope if i do try the medication and it does start to help with these feelings  i could be one of those people who come off and don t feel dependent on it    thanks in advanced

do you know what killed         people in the united states in just one year    in       that many people died from drug involved overdoses including illegal drugs and prescription opioids  over       according to  data  https   nida nih gov research topics trends statistics overdose death rates  from the national institute on drug abuse  the worst part about these statistics is the fact that the number of overdose deaths in      was over six times the number in       in just one year alone  from      to      the number of drug overdose deaths increased by more than        how did this happen  what led to such a serious crisis in the united states  are there any alternatives to opioid pain medicine that can help curb these devastating rates    while the answer to the first question is complex with various experts in the field agreeing that a multi system failure of regulation  including over prescribing  big pharma power and politics played an important part  the answer to the second one might be a bit simpler  over the past several years  there have been studies showing medical marijuana s potential in various pain treatments  while also revealing it can help curb opioid use    for example  the largest ever canadian supported study published in january viewed    randomized controlled trials involving        participants  the research concluded that marijuana provided similar  pain relief benefits as opioids but without negative consequences  https   www benzinga com markets cannabis                huge study reveals cannabis provides similar pain relief benefits as opioids without negative co     benzinga wanted to learn more about cannabis as an alternative to opioids and other medical marijuana benefits  so we reached out to   robin fowler m d     a board certified anesthesiologist with a fellowship in pain management from emory university in atlanta  fowler is also a founder of   botanical sciences    a physician     owned medical marijuana dispensary where a team of physicians prescribe cannabis over traditional opioids for pain management     after treating pain patients in an outpatient surgery setting for    years  i was ready to explore new ways to help my patients   fowler told benzinga   the georgia cannabis program gave me the opportunity to do just that  allowing me to treat patients  chronic pain with thc  from there  botanical sciences was born and we re now producing medical cannabis at our         square foot manufacturing facility in south georgia     what sets apart botanical sciences from other dispensaries is that it s georgia s first physician owned medical marijuana provider that is vertically integrated from seed to sale  he explained     we cultivate  process  distribute  and dispense all from our facility in glennville  georgia  we take the most scientific healthcare approach using evidence based formulations in our products that are most beneficial to the patients    fowler s first experience with medical marijuana was during his shoulder reconstruction surgery  when as a physician becoming a patient he was able to appreciate an alternative to opioids even more  his first educational experience was at a pain fellowship in      where the  learning curve took off once the medical program became closer to fruition in georgia   fowler recalled     the properties of medical cannabis for medical implications are in the early stages of being utilized as a therapeutic modality  we are fortunate to have a schedule a license with a patient pool of        to further our current studies  throughout the last fifteen years of practice  i wish it was an available option as i consider any reduction in opioid use a success              reduction in opioid use  how helpful is cannabis in reducing opioid use         overall  medical cannabis use supports a        reduction in opioid consumption   says fowler   not only does it control patients  pain but it is also beneficial for gastrointestinal and pulmonary function     fowler is also working on opioid reduction investigations and ways to determine the origin of a patient s pain     the electronic medical record kept on pain patients since      gives us a great data pool to do analysis  with over        patients  we re able to cross reference medical cannabis impact on morphine milligram equivalents  mme   additionally  other significant areas useful for patients and clinicians include all risk surgeries performed  back pain  medical cannabis and implants  these areas have been vastly under studied and i hope we can provide some valuable information     aside from pain management  what else can medical marijuana potentially treat   in the state of georgia  there are    health conditions that can qualify a patient for medical marijuana treatment  among these are cancer  neuromuscular diseases  sickle cell disease  autism spectrum disorder  aids  ptsd  and more  fowler adds that   there is a growing need for medical cannabis to be used to treat insomnia  some gastrointestinal diseases  and other debilitating conditions      see also     most important medical potential of marijuana  cannabis for pain relief says biotech ceo   https   www benzinga com markets cannabis                most important medical potential of marijuana cannabis for pain relief says biotech ceo     a thin line   while the marijuana industry is often broken into two markets   medical and recreational  some experts believe that the line is thinner than it may seem at first glance  this is because the majority of recreational users are actually consuming it to deal with various conditions whether extreme or mild  fowler agrees that the line is very thin  explaining that many people nowadays self diagnose with the help of the internet         that being said  when somebody has a condition such as pain or anxiety  they can treat that with over the counter products and that creates a very parallel situation with cannabis  specifically thc  then as diagnoses become more complex  such as neurological and psychiatric disorders  i believe medical professionals are best utilized to guide patients  this requires education and experience with medical professionals which are improving each day     while fowler doesn t see cannabis becoming its own boarded specialty  like internal medicine  he thinks requiring certifications and expert knowledge would be likely  he says he d be delighted to see more education on shared research and clinical experience     i think there needs to be more emphasis on generating awareness and educating the public on the benefits of cannabis in treating disease and other debilitating conditions   fowler concluded

they were just playing a game  and could do as they pleased   were they under the impression that there was never any possible way for this drug to make it as far as it did  so why even bother with the effort of bla assembly   they were receiving payments    were they convinced that cytodyn would just go out of business before the bla would ever have to be submitted   maybe amarex was never ever

the drug according to the principles of fairness regardless of what they believed or thought   had amarex believed in the drug  had they believed in the company of cytodyn  then they would not have done what they did   maybe they thought that everything would be gone by the time the submission of the bla became necessary  this way there would be no need to work at all on the data because it

for the drug to reach a new level in medicine  the next level of medicinal treatment   the plan for leronlimab to forge that transition from old medicine to a new form of medicine certainly was feasible because leronlimab was the most perfect drug designed perfectly for that very important purpose   but the individuals who were at work driving this game were irresponsible and wicked   every one of them lacked integrity   yet  these men were charged with the responsibility to deliver this next level  next generation drug to all of humanity   these individuals were somehow recklessly inclined to pervert the inherent freedom allotted to those given such an undertaking   therefore  look now at the roots of their hearts   how were they bred   as i said before  the most important part of the problem already was solved   that  of course was the creation of leronlimab   the drug  performs  https   www reddit com r leronlimab times comments y ojkm ccl ccr  axis in human diseases and related  utm source share utm medium web x utm name web xcss utm term   utm content share button  at a level that exceeds current medicine   even at levels that men are still trying to come to grips with  to grasp an understanding of   and man shall come to understand more completely and shall come to grips with the wonders of its capacity and what they learn and discover surely shall not cease to amaze     however  in the beginning  the medicine was unfortunately placed in the hands of men who lacked integrity   it was trialed by a cro that had no faith or belief in the drug they trialed  or no faith in the sponsor of those trials that the trials would definitely fail and fail they would   in addition  the company was created as an otc stock  making it exceedingly susceptible to the attacks of short sellers   all of this was brought together   rube goldberg  https   www reddit com r leronlimab times comments   mapwa distillation of the divide   fashion  in an effort to get leronlimab delivered to humanity   however  the last ingredient required to make this effort a success  was a deep seated motivation and zeal that it should come to reality   an absolute  deep seated  adamant adherence and commitment to absolutely everything necessary to making such an effort successful   but someone  somewhere  somehow  dropped the ball and lost that ingredient   these people instead started thinking with their pocketbooks instead of with their hearts  minds and conscious   all involved had to have a passion for the mission  checked by restraint  by laws  which had to be upheld as if they were the rule of the land   from the outside  it appeared as if it could work   the company was up and running  trials were getting done  just not  resulted  https   www reddit com r livimmune comments   f vjq signs     why not     shouldn t that have given off some clues that something was inherently wrong     shares were being traded and share were being shorted   sub contractors were getting hired and fired almost on a daily basis   it all appeared legit  but things were not even close to being perfect   later on though  we started seeing ambulance chasers   then the synchronized short attacks   however  a big blow came when fda imposed the clinical hold   shouldn t the fda have already had evidence that leronlimab was safe   why didn t the fda have that  evidence  https   www reddit com user mgk   comments   i ctg fair and square     why wasn t that information already in the hands of the fda   that information should have been supplied to the fda by those collecting that information  amarex   but  instead  they decided that they would blow that all off and conceal that data  even preventing access to it  despite still collecting wages regardless   why did they do that   were they living according to the law of the jungle  setting traps  stalking   survive by anyway you know how   they could not have believed in the drug   they only wanted free money   amarex knew what they had to do   they had no faith and no love for the purpose   they cared only for their pockets   in addition  they must have hated doing whatever they were doing   unfortunately  it was exactly that which they were hired for  but cytodyn never confirmed amarex s zeal to make this work   cytodyn failed to realize that in fact  amarex actually hated leronlimab and also hated cytodyn   amarex loved only amarex  but cytodyn handed them the work anyway   so  this grand solution to humanity s problem was and still is dependent upon a foundation of morality and integrity   both morality and integrity do produce an adamant adherence to the mission   without these two virtues  this solution to humanity s problem would be doomed to fail  and this was not realized at the outset  otherwise  it never would have been entrusted into incapable hands  and it did just about completely fail  but  miraculously  https   www reddit com r livimmune comments   pxxwm slowly but surely it becomes undeniable    it has persisted   today  it is in  better hands  https   www reddit com r livimmune comments   p nd  the comeback kid     that awakening occurred over the past few years     amarex needed to find a way to hide the data of the trial and to keep the data away from cytodyn   they did that by formatting the data in non approved  non standard methods   they gave the ownership of that data to yet another company  despite the fact that the data was owned by cytodyn     np knew only one tactic   he depended on the spewing of his knowledge and on getting the word out regarding leronlimab   his philosophy was to speak up at every available moment   he carried it too far though   np operated without rules   he was way outside the box   he operated in ways no public company should have   there was no order   there was no restraint   human nature ruled   deceitful and desperately wicked   and he told himself and all of us that he was a good person   who could know it   his reasoning was flawed  it was incorrect   and this too was at the root of the downfall   it ran rampant and unchecked     the solution has arisen   those that love the law are in charge now   there is order now   it has been restored   there is  freedom  https   www reddit com r leronlimab times comments   fq rj turning point   now  but there is also restraint   they have freedom  but they operate with restraint   when np originally bought leronlimab  it was like he bought the car  then  he reached into the glove box and found the owner s manual  then threw it immediately in the street and said   i don t need no owner s manual  this is my car  i run it the way i want to    he drove leronlimab without an owner s manual  damn near into the ground   things fell apart   why   because he threw the manual away     lalezari is more considerate of the missing link   integrity   morality   lalezari has a deep respect for authority as both he and his father are physicians  bred appropriately  and he is comfortable in their presence  and they are comfortable in his   lalezari has the owner s manual clutched between his hands   he reads it night and day because he possesses integrity

tw  infertility  pregnancy loss  sexual assault  ptsd   sorry about the length but i really needed to let this out  i haven t been able to really say the whole story like this  i m stuck awake anyway because i accidentally took the daytime medication dose instead of my sleep medication so i thought i d try   what happened to me is so insane that i still don t really understand it  i can t believe it  or maybe i m just still in shock  i keep going over and over it   i have pretty severe adhd as well as non verbal learning disorder  i ve never been in a real  adult  romantic relationship before  and once i hit    i started thinking seriously about trying to have a child by myself  i d done a lot of work on myself since college  and i was finally in a place where i thought i would just about be able to afford it with some  offered  family help with childcare  etc  i had no reason to believe i d be infertile  but the first iui didn t work and a blockage was discovered in my right fallopian tube  the fertility doctor refused to try another iui unless i had that tube removed  so in june of      that surgery took place   unfortunately  it was discovered during the surgery that both of my tubes were blocked  so both of them were removed  which i was informed of directly upon waking up from surgery  while i afforded nearly all of the iui by myself  there was no way i could afford ivf  i agonized for months  all my life i had been terrified of infertility and i had hoped by starting earlier than most i could have avoided it  finally left my job  i didn t even want to leave my job  it had given me a ton of confidence when i was able to thrive there  for the most part   i was proud of myself for leaving at the time  since i m generally quite passive and nervous about that level of risk with anything to do with money   the new job was with a call center for a financial company  it was absolute havok on my anxiety but i held out as long as i could  i made it from november      to august   th        in july  i did the egg retrieval   meaning i was on some level of fertility medication from the end of may to the end of august  we got    eggs  and   embryos  my parents even paid for chromosomal testing  so i ended up with   genetically normal   day blastocysts    boys and   girls  the doctor told me flat out   you will never have to have another egg retrieval   it was literally the first uplifting news  the first time anything with right at all  since i started trying to have a child at all   however  i was secretly mentally cratering  my depression from the continued obstacles in my fertility  journey   lmao what the fuck ever  mixed with my anxiety from work plus the fertility hormone cocktail meant i called out sick pretty much as often as i could and even when i couldn t  i was shaking like a leaf the whole time i had a call come in  i thought the abilitty to work from home would make up for the shitty job but it absolutely did not and in fact made it worse  i tried so hard to just stick it out  i tried to get through with edibles to calm me down  i had my aniexty medication dosage increased  after my meds had been stable for years which was huge for me   none of it worked  and in the middle of jine  i just started calling in sick every single day  i was in physical pain from the anxiety and the depression was keeping me bedridden so much that  in february i hurt my back enough that i needed physical therapy  but i was so fixated on just keeping their excellent insurance that i just kept silent to anyone who could have helped me and pretended everything was fine so i could go through this without anyone talking me down   somehow through a combination of doctor s notes about my back and the company being very heavily automated i still hadn t been fired by the company  i went further  the embryo transfer was done on august  nd of      and i still don t know why i did this except i was stuck on the idea that if i had the transfer done before they fired me  it would still be covered under insurance  like i could just sneak a baby through with me like an office stapler   even the embryo transfer felt ominous  i had told the clinic that i didn t want to choose the biological sex  because having a choice at all made me uncomfortable  it felt so strange that i had to consciously choose a race for the baby  i was like     i guess white    i told them just to use the best quality one they had  but then on the morning of the transfer  i got a call from the clinic that the first embryo died during the unfreezing process  that s a  somewhat rare thing to happen  but they said they would just unfreeze the next best one   the embryo was biologically female   i wanted a girl   came out of my mouth immediately  i asked  and the embryo that died was a boy  i felt like this girl was meant to be a little bit  it felt so right to have her there  i had slight pregnancy symptoms pretty early  nausea out of nowhere   and i just felt a hundred percent sure that it had worked  i was right  on august  th i was confirmed to be pregnant  on august   th i finally lost my job   finanacially this is absolutely the worst possible option  i still don t know why i did it  but it felt so right and i felt so connected to the world for the first time in months  i knew how bad this was  i knew i d been ignoring my mental health and it was out of control  i knew it was wayyy too early to think about having a child  but i just didn t care in the face of that good feeling  i d never experienced anything like it before  i just started applying to jobs and thinking about sacrifices i could make to get us through this   on august   th  i went to the clinic for what was supposed to be my final ultrasound  i threw up for the very first time on the way out the door  and honestly was grateful for it  the ultrasound tech was very quiet  and spoke somewhat limited english  she spent a long time looking  and apologizing for not finding it  then saying she was going to get the doctor  i thought maybe she just needed some help finding it  but a large part of me knew  even then   the pregnancy wasn t there  because it was in the stump of the right fallopian tube that had caused trouble in the first place  i had a tubal pregnancy  with no fallopian tubes   the ooctor said  this shouldn t have happened  like six times and actually told me i should think about legal action  that ended up not going anywhere  no law firms seemed interested in taking my case   i needed emergency surgery  and i had it at about    hours later on august   th  i was absolutely stunned and felt just    deeply main character but in a mean book  i couldn t get over this weird bad luck  i d prepared myself for the ivf not working  or for a miscarriage  but certainly not the one thing that had supposedly been prevented  i felt like it was karma for me being so stupid  i still feel like that  i put everything i had into that one basket  retirement savings and credit included   i spent about   weeks in mourning  mostly in bed  getting very high on edibles almost the entire time  i was just getting out of the deepest depression and had actually just arranged for a job interview when my apartment was broken into  at about four am on september   rd  i was lying in bed watching youtube videos when a stranger got into my bed with me  i tried to fight him  but he had a gone and pistol whipped me about     times  opening up a very long gash in my head   he proceeded to rape me several times while i was heavily bleeding  he would not leave afterward  and i kept looking at the gun while sitting on the edge of my bed  i finally told him i was going to the hospital  put on a shirt  slipped on some flipflops   left   i drove myself to the hospital  they sent the police who found him still in my apartment  literally red handed   he was still in my bed  i mostly just remember being very concerned for my cats and desperately wanting to rinse the blood out of my hair and off of my face  my mom and i had to wait for a few hours after being discharged  and we went to target to get me some clothes   then to olive garden because i asked for it for some reason  it was the most surreal feeling  i kept thinking that i thought the worst thing in my life had already happened to me   since then i ve been a wreck  i have full blown ptsd  i m basically a recluse now  i am on edibles almost every day  my adhd medication doesn t work anymore  and i am now living in my parents  unfinished basement with my cats  personal hygeine is even worse and i m barely able to keep myself sort of fed on something  i actually went to a job interview on september   th  less than a week later  with two black eyes and a bandaged forehead  and i got the job  it must have been a pity invite  almost immediately the ptsd was too much for me to be in an office environment  and i lost that job too  i have intense panic whenever i need to make any decisions because i m convinced they re all wrong  i m also convinced that my mental health will never be good enough to try to have kids ever again  and last month i got a letter letting me know that my payment is due for storage for my five remaining embryos  which i anticipated and was expecting  but the letter also announced that the price went up over      this year  lmao   the man who asssaulted me was found incompetant to stand trial last week   and now it s fucking mother s day weekend 
this article was originally published on  cannabis net  https   cannabis net blog medical cannabis is now the best solution for migraine headaches according to   new medical studies  and appears here with permission   migraine sufferers drop prescription drugs at record pace and switch to cannabis for headache pain   ask anyone who s ever suffered from chronic migraines  and they can tell you that these headaches can rob you of quality of life  migraines are by no means just any type of headache  they can result in symptoms such as irritability  nausea  and fatigue on top of the migraine pain  these symptoms  in turn  can be triggered by simple things such as lights  movements  and sound   while some individuals experience acute migraines  there are many who suffer from chronic or long lasting migraine episodes  these can last for several hours  making it impossible to continue with work and play  migraines are also extremely common  affecting some     of the worldwide population   since there are so many different factors that can cause migraines  it can be difficult to treat  there are many things that can cause migraines  such as hormonal fluctuations  for women   alcohol use  lack of sleep  side effect of medications  and even genetics  there are a range of specialized pharmaceutical medications that have been developed to treat migraines  such as beta blockers and triptans such as eletriptan  sumatriptan  triptan  rizatriptan  and many more   however  these migraine medications also may come with side effects  triptans  in particular  are commonly associated with limb heaviness  fatigue  tightness in the jaw  chest  or throat  and myalgias     that said  cannabis has been shown to be as effective as prescription medications without the side effects  or are even more effective   the good news is that cannabis has been shown to be extremely beneficial for migraine sufferers  the human body has several endocannabinoid receptors  many of which are concentrated in the central nervous system as well as the brain  when you have a migraine and medicate with cannabis  the cannabinoids bind with these receptors to provide relief   there are several studies that back up these claims  too   in march       the results of  a study  https   pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov            conducted by researchers from yale school of medicine was published  the investigators polled feedback from       patients at a tertiary headache clinic  with less than a third of them reporting that they are current cannabis users   for the cannabis consumers  a majority said that it either improved symptoms or at least reduced the frequency of migraines  meanwhile      of respondents said that cannabis consumption also helped them decrease or completely eliminate their prescription medications for migraines   this is the largest study to date to document cannabis product usage patterns and perceived benefits for migraine management in a clinical headache patient sample  concluded the study authors   a majority of patients surveyed reported using cannabis products for migraine management and cited perceived improvements in migraine characteristics  clinical features  and associated risk factors  they added     other studies back up cannabis  safety and efficacy for migraines  researchers from the university of california at san diego  published results of a clinical trial  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc           last february       the trials involved analyzing the safety and efficacy of herbal cannabis for    patients who suffered from persistent migraines  the cannabis flower used for the trial contained both cbd and thc   the patients were randomly given vaporized cannabis in various ratios  containing a range of thc and cbd  as well as placebo after they experienced migraines  they researchers found that out of the   cannabis chemotypes  the vaporized cannabis with both thc and cbd were the most effective    vaporized    thc       cbd cannabis flower was superior to placebo for pain relief  pain freedom  and mbs   most bothersome symptom   freedom at   hours as well as    hour sustained pain freedom and sustained mbs freedom and    hour sustained mbs freedom  said the authors  in addition  they found that the thc cbd flower was more effective than placebo when it came to providing relief from photophobia  or light sensitivity  as well as sound sensitivity caused by migraines   it s also good to note that the participants did not report any adverse side effects during the trial   future research should include multicenter studies and long term studies of benefits and risks with repeated use  concluded the investigators   there are also studies that validate the safety of cannabis in treating migraines  for one  let s take a review conducted by investigators at the california institute of behavioral neurosciences and psychology  the investigators analyzed   recent studies which assessed more than       subjects    all the studies showed encouraging findings on the therapeutic effects of medicinal marijuana in migraine treatment  additionally  medical marijuana is well tolerated with fewer side effects and is safe to use in migraine patients  the authors reported    the studies demonstrated that medical marijuana has a significant clinical response by reducing the length and frequency of migraines  no severe adverse effects were noted  due to its effectiveness and convenience  medical marijuana therapy may be helpful for patients suffering from migraines  they concluded     conclusion  based on research  cannabis flower and other products that contain both thc and cbd are the most effective  however  cannabis isn t a one size fits all solution  and there is no standardized dosage recommendation for migraine patients just yet   you may have to experiment with various products and doses to find one that works well for you  be open and you might just find the perfect cannabis product for your medical needs

hi all   i m curious what people might think about developing empirical approaches from current unsupported approaches    internal family systems is especially common in my area  and therapists are constantly talking about it  it makes me wonder if there are indeed might be helpful elements to the method   in  pseudoscience in therapy  https   www cambridge org core books abs pseudoscience in therapy dissociation   b  c dbdd f    dc   bc   bcd    the authors talk briefly about ifs as an unsupported treatment method for dissociation  but some new data has arrived claiming ifs is based on existing and well supported theory of treatment  brenner et al          this study is not my favorite tbh  too much opinion   and even a pilot study which shows significant reduction in ptsd symptomology  hodgdon et al         this one is pretty comprehensive and solid looking to me    in the chapter from pseudoscience in therapy by lynn et al   it appears that there has been one case of an individual with very poor outcomes who was treated at an eating disorder clinic which uses ifs  however  i don t think this in itself is evidence that ifs cannot be a valuable treatment  and i wonder if it represents a misunderstanding of the treatment as performed by that therapist  this client was labeled with    separate identities as a part of did dx   to me  the recognition of internal narratives which promote avoidance and pliance are well supported in the cbt literature and serve as common treatment targets   the process of developing an ebp from the apa includes the following steps  clinical observation  qualitative data  systematic case studies  single case experimental designs  public health ethnographic research  process outcome studies  mechanism of change   studies of interventions in their environment  rct s  meta analysis   apa        https   www apa org pubs journals features evidence based statement pdf      i wonder    what would need to occur further to develop an ebp from ifs  what would you want to see in a randomized trial for ifs  which one of those steps is most interesting to you and how would you design a study around the missing links most unsupported elements of ifs

for anyone here who was part of any of the clinical trials and didn t receive the placebo  care to share your experience  did it bring you in range thus requiring less insulin     years ago  https   youtu be  mxlvv st s  today      yo trials starting soon  i think i understand why in my homeland t d is unheard of  you can t diagnose what isn t there 
i absolutely love my clinic and my coworkers and managers but we have been very badly effected by a lack of staff and i feel guilty about how much these parents are paying not knowing how little programs are getting run during parts of the day  some days the integrated preschool just needs so much help that rbts have to step in so much that a client may have less than    programs ran in a roughly   hour session  some of the integrated kids have more behaviors and need more help than the clients do so they can be very demanding attention wise at times  i try and run as many programs as i can in the afternoon after i get a client that s affected by an understaffed or chaotic preschool day but feel bad throwing so many programs at a kid in a short span  some kids just can t handle that many programs in a short span especially after a whole morning of not doing much and having minimal demands placed  i also feel like i should tell the parents they re kids didn t do many programs all morning but i know i d probably get in trouble for that so i won t which is just making me feel even more guilty  i know i wouldn t want to pay that much money knowing that my kid wasn t running programs for hours of the day because other kids needed help  what can i do to get trial counts up when the other rbts just aren t running programs because they re too busy helping with other kids  i just don t know what to do in my situation it feels like all i can do is push my kids harder to pick up the slack which hurts my pairing with the kids because i become the hard teacher that makes them do more work than they re other therapists and that doesn t let them play as much

i don t have insurance   the clinic wants to sell me the resmed    for       canadian    a year of filters and a cleaning kit included    i can get the resmed    direct for       canadian   but if i need help setting it up they will charge me       or the resmed    for      canadian   i am wondering how much i will need the respiratory therapist guidance or if i can figure and make adjustments myself   i am very tech savvy  and have no problem researching and doing trial and error 
i am in austin  and it seems almost every trial necessitates something other than just obesity overweight  does anyone have a line on recruiting or soon to recruit studies

i don t even know what to say  i ve been on   antidepressants  they told me i don t communicate well enough to be able to do therapy  my next appointment is tomorrow but i read my notes from my last review and it essentially says they re planning on discharging me because i haven t gotten any better  in what world is this right  surely patients who aren t getting better are the ones that need help the most  they haven t even exercised all their options  there are classes of antidepressant i haven t been put on yet  and the ones they have tried they haven t given me long enough prescriptions for  some of them have been for   week    weeks  i haven t been on any longer than a month  it s like they haven t even tried but they re blaming me for not improving  i truly want to end my life now  this was my only hope and if they discharge me  i have no other services to get help from  the iapt said my case was too complex for them to handle   this is what the cmht wrote in my last review     we felt the best way forward at the moment was for her to take the duloxetine as originally planned  if this was effective then we could move on to the next stage  if this is ineffective then we are limited in our options as to what can be tolerated and it may be that we do not consider medication as a viable option  we do not feel that it will be beneficial to continue to offer various types of medications as this clearly reduces her overall sense of hope     we agreed that  care coordinator  would be in contact with her next week to look at next steps and that we will review things again once we are able to see how the duloxetine has gone   my name  gives a sense of being disappointed by this however this has always been her presentation and we feel that the best way forward at this moment in time is to make small clinically informed decisions to see if she is willing to work with us on these  this is felt to be within her best interests otherwise we would be unable to move forward and we will struggle to develop any form of meaningful engagement     should we not be able to do this following a further trial of medication and various suggestions about how she can develop psychological engagement  it may be that we consider that monntana has a time away from services to collect her thoughts and to return when she feels more able to express herself  this obviously carries an element of risk in that she may feel rejected by this approach however when she attends and we are unable to meet her needs this may be a more risk laden approach as this can decrease her hope    i m being left to fend for myself  i don t understand how their main concern could be decreasing my hope and yet they fail to see how discharging me leaves me with absolutely no hope at all

quick info regarding my gastritis   i was diagnosed with h  pylori in      and got stomach ulcers  got on triple therapy antibiotics and ppi  now i m h  pylori negative   after three months i was healed  so i thought   so i went back to my old habits such as eating junk food  long sitting on computer  and pretty much everything i was not suppose to do or eat for gerd diet  the flare up came back after two weeks as i didn t let it heal properly and now it turned into chronic stomach gastritis  stomach lining inflamation   endoscopy confirmed it   it s been about a year now living with gastritis and constantly researching trying to figure out how to heal gastritis   i was talking with openai s chatgpt     trying to educate myself on how the body works and eventually asked this question   me    if the first line of treatment does not work for healing stomach gastritis  what are other approaches  even approaches that may not be currently fda approved but  evidence for animal testing like rats  mice  etc   proven to work    note  the first line of treatment includes  triple therapy antibiotics to eradicate bacterias  h  blockers  ppi  symptoms include history of h pylori but h pylori is killed but the damage remains of ulcers later turned into gastritis   chatgpt s response    see    about stem cell therapy            probiotics    although commonly used and available over the counter  the use of probiotics for gastritis is still under research  probiotics can help restore the balance of good bacteria in the stomach  which might be disrupted after long courses of antibiotics         dietary changes    adjusting the diet to eliminate or reduce foods that irritate the stomach lining can help manage symptoms  this is not a cure  but it can significantly alleviate discomfort and promote healing         experimental therapies    there are ongoing studies into various new drugs and biological therapies that aim to more effectively target the inflammatory processes involved in gastritis  these are not widely available and would typically be accessed through clinical trials         stem cell therapy    some very early stage research has looked at the potential of stem cells to heal damaged gastric tissues in animal models  this is far from being an approved treatment but is an area of interest for future therapies   me    what is stem cell therapy  how can it be used for gastritis   chatgpt s response    stem cell therapy involves using stem cells  which are special cells that have the ability to develop into many different types of cells in the body  this therapy is based on the idea that stem cells can be used to repair or replace damaged tissue  here s how it works and how it might be applied to conditions like gastritis    how stem cell therapy works         source    stem cells can be sourced from various parts of the body  including bone marrow  fat tissue  or even blood  there are also pluripotent stem cells  which can be engineered in the lab to become any type of cell needed         preparation    once collected  these stem cells are prepared and possibly manipulated in a lab to enhance their therapeutic potential         administration    the prepared stem cells are then reintroduced into the patient s body  targeting the area where repair or regeneration is needed       potential use for gastritis    in the context of gastritis  the chronic inflammation damages the stomach lining  leading to ulcers and other painful symptoms  here s how stem cell therapy could potentially help         regeneration    stem cells could be directed to the damaged areas of the stomach lining to promote regeneration of the tissue  effectively repairing the damage caused by gastritis         anti inflammatory properties    some studies suggest that stem cells can modulate the immune system and reduce inflammation  which would be beneficial in reducing the symptoms of gastritis         restoration of function    by regenerating healthy tissue  stem cell therapy could help restore normal function to the stomach lining  potentially reversing the effects of chronic gastritis    research and limitations   while the potential is significant  stem cell therapy for gastritis is still in the early stages of research  primarily at the preclinical level with animal studies  the challenges include ensuring the safety of the therapy  such as preventing the stem cells from differentiating into unwanted tissue types or causing immune reactions    given these factors  stem cell therapy for gastritis isn t currently available as a standard treatment and would typically be accessed through clinical trials  further research and development are needed to determine its efficacy and safety for regular clinical use

those of you who have been a part of the spg community for a while may have noticed that i have gone from being a prolific poster and moderator on this sub to making only rare appearances over the last year or so  i ve always been fairly private about my health struggles    no doubt due to some preconceived notions that i shouldn t burden others or that it would be attention seeking to do so  which had me wondering  are there other people like me wrestling with chronic health issues in silence who feel helpless and hopeless because nobody is talking about it  and although my medical issues have placed barriers in front of me that rival mt  everest  i can also say that it led me to opportunities that i never would have had when i was  healthy   so here is a  much abridged  account of how chronic illness led me to spg and what it means for my future with the subreddit    https   imgur com a rfulno      there are always two kinds of pets     https   preview redd it m  urecawfzc  jpg width      format pjpg auto webp s b  d   ad  b   f  f c ee  a a bc    bdb    it s a running joke in my family that i would have needed an entire season of house  m d  to figure out everything that was wrong with me  and of course it was never anything normal or easily diagnosed  so when i started getting excruciating headaches at the age of    it took months  and  i kid you not  my mother doing a google search  before i was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri  now more commonly known as intracranial hypertension   luckily medical treatments and the power of youth meant i was able to get back on track  graduating first from high school and then from college  i eagerly enrolled in an internship program in london  ready to travel the world and be a badass adult  that was until my little intracranial friend decided to pop back for a visit and i was forced to return home  recovery took longer this time around  and after several months of bedrest i had a new plan  perhaps jet setting businesswoman was beyond my reach  but this could be my sign to pursue something i ve always loved  gemology   i enrolled in the gemological institute of america  gia  s graduate gemologist program in carlsbad  ca and somehow fell even more in love with gemstones  i accepted a position as a diamond grader in the gia laboratory after receiving my diploma and life was good   i had friends  an exciting new job  and access to the gia library  except i was suddenly so exhausted that i could barely function  my hair was falling out  and i could barely eat   the battery of tests began and they found the culprit  or so they thought  in the form of hypothyroidism  i took the drugs and felt much more awake   thyroid hormones will do that   so everything was fine and dandy  until the medications slowly stopped working and nobody had a good answer  i was eventually placed on medical leave and six months later was let go from my dream job  once again i packed up my life and returned back home to my parents  weak as a newborn kitten and twice as confused   i started collecting diagnoses the way some people collect certifications  can you imagine how desirable i d look on a resume if those were interchangeable  liss manners  iih  heds  mcas  pots  oi  gp  adhd et al  my bingo card for medical specialists is blacked out and i m pretty sure my general practitioner back in carlsbad heaved a huge sigh of relief when i left and became someone else s problem  just the battle to get seen or believed by doctors has been a trial in and of itself  i have been on waitlists for months  even years  to be seen by specialists for supposedly rare disorders that are likely just severely underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed  and i m actually rather lucky compared to many of my fellow spoonies   i was a few hours both from vanderbilt university and their dysautonomia clinic and iupui s ehlers danlos society program  without that kind of pedigree backing up my diagnoses  i would still be hearing  are you sure you aren t just deconditioned   and  have you tried exercising   from every doctor   so there i was  twenty eight years old  unable to work  waiting for my next appointment or medication  and i discovered reddit  i was late to the party  don t hold it against me   at the time  spg had maybe       followers and jim was just starting to dip his toes into jewelry settings  i entered a giveaway and won  a teeny blue spinel octahedron that i still have   and found myself welcomed into the community with open arms  let me tell you  it was truly lovely to get to talk about rocks and nerdy gem trivia again  i may have been     couch cushion at that point in time but i had found my people  and i also managed to meet my darling husband  u retribution     who was thrilled to learn that i was in fact not a romanian bridge troll or a    something man in his mom s basement with cheetos fingers   recovery resembled more of a straight line than an upward slope  but when i was asked to write the occasional article for spg i jumped at the chance to do a bit of work during my sporadic bouts of productivity  the decision to start tackling emails and moderation was harder  but at the time we were a much smaller community and i only had      hours of work per week  i don t know if any of us could have expected the sub to grow so quickly  but it was truly astonishing to watch it flourish  and slowly  bit by bit  the hours started to add up and i believed i was healthy enough to keep up  for someone who claims that history is her favorite subject  i have a bad habit of ignoring my own   until my hair started to fall out again   in typical liss fashion  i took on too much  what was once less than ten hours of work each week had turned into twenty or thirty hours of constant emails and i didn t even have the time or mental energy to also do articles or interact with the community   the things that i really loved doing  in the last few months i ve had to  go on sick leave  multiple times and it has led to delays and miscommunications over emails  something has to change   jim is working towards adding some new people to the spg team  so if you see heidi or cheryl in the emails  make them feel at home   and i will be rethinking my role in the group and how i can contribute while still balancing my health  whether this means transitioning to a position that is less time constrained or working with the new staff to make sure that there aren t major delays during a flare i don t know   i do know that i wouldn t be where i am without all of you  having such a supportive community means everything  and i ve been so grateful to have the opportunity to contribute and be a part of it  y all aren t getting rid of me  don t you worry  i have lots of ideas for future content percolating in my frazzled little brain  and a few measly medical disorders haven t stopped me before   tl dr  i m going through some health stuff and stepping back from a public role at spg for a while to focus on short term recovery and developing a sustainable long term plan  please give jim a bit of time to sort things out with emails and current projects  i love you all and my nurses  shadow catto and lillibutt  are taking good    care of me  and for anyone else out there who is going through something similar  remember   you don t

a big part of our problem is damage to the auditory nerve synapse  where it connects to the cochlea   simply losing hair cells with age vs destroying them with noise drugs is the difference between hearing loss with or without tinnitus  when you destroy them with noise it also damages the synapse  hair cells can only be regenerated using various chemicals and gene therapies and that science is still in its infancy  regenerating synapse damage is in a more advanced state  if this drug which is entering phase   clinical trials works to heal this damage  then we will finally have a treatment  this is the best thing on the horizon  there needs to be the same kind of hype for this that there is for the susan shore device if not more     https   www cilcare com our missions   https   www cilcare com our missions  
i spent quality time looking for research on jett plasma pen and plasma energy for mgd ded and did not find much directly related to the jett plasma pen or any directly related to ded mgd either  yet  clearly the treatment is happening  particularly in europe for ded mgd likely since the jett plasma pen is approved  for use in the eu   i don t know exactly what to make of that  could be my research skills  but i doubt that since i have found plenty of research on plenty of other treatment approaches  now there is a lot of research of plasma energy being used in medicine and some in ophthalmology

the terms  cold energy plasma  and  hot energy plasma  generally refer to different states of ionized gas  known as plasma  used for various therapeutic applications and researched a lot  here s how they differ per chatgpt        cold plasma   temperature  cold plasma operates at or near room temperature  making it suitable for application on or near human tissue without causing thermal damage   mechanism  it works primarily through the generation of reactive species and ions that can interact with biological tissues  these reactive particles can induce specific biochemical responses   uses  cold plasma is used in dermatology for skin rejuvenation  wound healing  and disinfection because it can effectively kill bacteria and stimulate tissue regeneration without harming the skin  it s also researched for cancer treatment  where it might induce cancer cell death while sparing healthy cells   hot plasma   temperature  hot plasma is much higher in temperature  typically in the thousands of degrees celsius  it is not applied directly to the body but is used in devices that require plasma s properties at high temperatures   mechanism  the energy of hot plasma comes from the kinetic energy of its particles  including ions and electrons  which are much higher than in cold plasma   uses  in medical tools  hot plasma can be used in surgical applications  such as plasma scalpels for cutting through tissue or cauterizing wounds  the high temperature allows precise cuts and can reduce bleeding by sealing blood vessels   the primary difference lies in their application methodologies and temperature ranges  which define their suitability for direct or indirect medical applications   in this case to help me find research i asked the following of chatgpt         what can you tell me about the medical research on jett plasma treatment for dry eye disease and meibomian gland dysfunction     chatgpt     answers   research into the use of jett plasma treatment for dry eye disease  ded  and meibomian gland dysfunction  mgd  is still emerging  with clinical trials and studies being conducted to evaluate its efficacy and safety  the focus is largely on how plasma energy can be used to improve ocular surface health and gland function  here are some key aspects of the current research in this area     mechanism of action    the theoretical basis for using jett plasma in treating ded and mgd hinges on its ability to   stimulate cellular regeneration  plasma energy may help in regenerating damaged or dysfunctional cellular structures in the eyelids and ocular surface   reduce microbial load  plasma has antimicrobial properties that could reduce the bacterial load on the eyelids  potentially addressing one of the contributory factors in mgd   improve gland functionality  by delivering energy directly to the meibomian glands  jett plasma might help in unblocking the glands and improving the secretion and quality of meibum   clinical trials and studies  pilot studies  initial pilot studies often focus on assessing the safety of the jett plasma treatment  looking for any adverse effects or immediate benefits in treating ded and mgd   randomized controlled trials  rcts   more rigorous rcts are required to provide reliable data on the efficacy of the treatment  these studies compare outcomes from patients receiving jett plasma treatments with those receiving standard treatments or placebo   longitudinal studies  long term follow up studies are crucial to understanding the longevity of the treatment effects and any long term complications or benefits   research findings  early research findings have suggested some potential benefits  including improvements in symptoms of ded and signs of mgd  such as reduced gland blockage and increased lipid layer thickness  however  comprehensive results and peer reviewed studies are needed to validate these initial findings   current status  as of the latest updates  comprehensive large scale results are still pending  the medical community awaits more detailed data from ongoing or future studies that could corroborate the preliminary positive outcomes and clarify the role of jett plasma treatment in routine clinical practice    i could not find any research studies at all on     considerations for future research    future research will need to address several aspects   standardization of treatment protocols  determining the optimal settings  number of treatments needed  and intervals between treatments   patient selection criteria  identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from jett plasma treatments   comparison with existing therapies  evaluating how jett plasma stands up against current standard therapies for ded and mgd in terms of effectiveness and cost efficiency   for patients and practitioners interested in the latest developments in jett plasma research for ded and mgd  staying informed through clinical trial registries or publications in ophthalmology journals is advisable  engaging with specialists who are involved in research or who keep up with the latest treatments can also provide valuable insights and access to new therapeutic options as they become validated and available   unfortunately  there doesn t appear to be direct references or focused studies on the jett plasma pen s application specifically for dry eye disease and meibomian gland dysfunction  it seems the usage of plasma technology in these conditions is still an emerging field or not extensively documented in the available literature    so there we go  i will have to leave it at this point  maybe some readers will be able to point us to specific research using the plasma energy tools at some point

pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue  leading to difficulty breathing and impaired lung function  while there is no cure for pulmonary fibrosis  various treatments and therapies aim to manage symptoms  slow disease progression  and improve quality of life  here are some common treatments     medications     corticosteroids  drugs like prednisone may be prescribed to reduce inflammation in the lungs and slow the progression of fibrosis  however  long term use of corticosteroids can have significant side effects and is often limited to specific situations immunosuppressants  medications that suppress the immune system  such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide  may be prescribed in some cases to reduce inflammation and slow scarring in the lungs antifibrotic drugs  two medications  pirfenidone and nintedanib  have been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  ipf   these drugs can slow the progression of fibrosis and improve lung function in some patients     oxygen therapy     supplemental oxygen is often prescribed to relieve shortness of breath and improve oxygen levels in the blood  oxygen therapy can help patients with pulmonary fibrosis perform daily activities more comfortably and improve their quality of life     pulmonary rehabilitation     pulmonary rehabilitation programs offer a comprehensive approach to managing pulmonary fibrosis  these programs typically include exercise training  education about the disease and self management strategies  breathing techniques  and nutritional counseling  pulmonary rehabilitation can improve exercise tolerance  reduce symptoms  and enhance overall well being     supportive therapies     smoking cessation  quitting smoking is essential for patients with pulmonary fibrosis  as smoking can worsen lung function and accelerate disease progression nutritional support  maintaining a healthy diet and adequate nutrition is important for patients with pulmonary fibrosis to support overall health and strength     lung transplantation     for some patients with advanced pulmonary fibrosis and severe respiratory impairment  lung transplantation may be considered  lung transplantation can improve survival and quality of life in carefully selected candidates     clinical trials     participation in clinical trials may offer access to new and emerging treatments for pulmonary fibrosis  researchers are constantly investigating potential therapies to better understand the disease and develop more effective treatments     palliative care     palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life for patients with pulmonary fibrosis by managing symptoms  providing emotional support  and addressing end of life care needs  palliative care specialists work collaboratively with the patient s medical team to provide comprehensive care and support   treatment for pulmonary fibrosis is tailored to each individual based on the severity of the disease  symptoms  and overall health status  it s essential for patients to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and goals 
i wonder how close we are to a treatment or cure that can reverse ted  without the hearing loss issues that tepezza has  aside from participating in clinical trials  how can we help push this to the forefront of science  any medical experts or scientists who could have a reasonable guess  am i going to be waiting    more years in pain   besides tepezza  i don t know how long research has been in progress for this  especially for not only those with graves but hashimotos and other thyroid conditions  they say ted is a rare disease but i m not so sure it is  it feels like a lot of people have it and don t realize they do  or have ted but minimal to moderate ted   which does a different kind of damage to the eyes and vision from what i understand from the lack of bulging 
hi everyone   i know this sub is more for those who work in the industry but i m hoping maybe i could get some tips on trial applications  i m interested in a clinical trial for a disease i have and i m having trouble getting in touch with the research team  i fit the eligibility requirements  i submitted an interest form with basic contact info and left a short message about my age  gender  and diagnosis with the school performing the trials  i got a follow up response  probably an automatic thing  that sent the trial s contact person info  i sent them an email last week and left them a voicemail this week and have gotten no response back  i m curious if this is normal and i should just continue to wait for a response  or if i should try reaching out again  i m sure the clinical staff are a busy group and i don t want to bother them too much if that s unnecessary  for those working in the clinical trial industry  at what point do you contact interested participants

hello world  please humor me and my long post     i m very interested in understanding my cognitive profile better  and want to do also take an iq test which is not impacted by my specific learning disabilities   a bit about me  diagnosed with mild cerebral palsy as an infant  did well at school but always took a while for things to  click  and i had to study v hard   whilst i did reasonably ok in maths  i really struggled with mechanics  even though i studied very hard i got a d grade and never really understood why and wonder if my poor block design score could explain this    i was thought to be the  dim one  amongst   children growing up because i worked so hard compared to my siblings   im now a physician  and also done a phd  not technically challenging a phd in clinical trials with some meta analysis validation statistics   i m now doing a post doc in machine learning   i get that working hard is just as important as intelligence but a part of me is disappointed  i feel like the test i have shared affirms this belief  i am surround by people who excel brilliant etc so know i shouldn t but always compare myself and think about my  average  or even poor cognitive profile with poor working memory  i know it s daft and i d tell someone else they are being ridiculous but still    i took this exam during my phd aged     told to go for an assessment because my supervisors didn t like my writing  assessor said he was amazed i got to that point without anyone picking it up before   during this assessment  they suggested i have dyslexia and dyspraxia  i have since been diagnosed with mild adhd  combined type  and have recently started medication   i struggle with some confidence issues  ie i feel i m not really smart and perhaps only get to where i am because i work hard and a fraud  probably compounded by my phd experience  supervisors told me to quit phd and leave medicine because of my diagnosis  that was a while ago and i haven t had any negative experiences since  done therapy  really don t think anything will help change this belief unless i do something objective eg iq test  right now i have objective evidence to affirm my belief system   also  even though i got feedback  i still struggled to understand what my weaknesses really are and the best learning approach for me  i have one more year of my machine learning post doc and really want to finish it   mostly  how to improve skills in coding and the big thinking part eg how to prepare data etc for machine learning modeling    appreciate all suggestions and constructive feedback    thanks for listening to my ted talk 
you may have read my freakout about the fumi vadim swan lake a few days ago lol  at the end of which i said i d come and review the winter s tale  so here it is  a few days late but i promptly fell asleep after getting back to my hotel and then forgot abt it lol  overall i liked it very much  in the key role of leontes  matthew ball was suitably jealously unhinged and really portrayed his heartbreak and remorse later on in the ballet very well  his reunion with perdita was very moving  great performance overall  i will say though  at multiple occasions during the performance all i could think was  man i wish i could have seen ed watson in this    i ve only seen him do this role on the recording but he s such a distinctive dancer and it s so blatant the role was choreographed on him that i really feel like it would have made the ballet a totally different experience    the highlights for me were the following   pedita and florizel  the day started with me receiving a cast change email  after promptly shitting myself at the prospect of not seeing marianela  i was relieved as hell to see it was for perdita and florizel  now don t get me wrong i m obviously not glad will bracewell was injured  hope he recovers soon   but tbqh i couldn t really see him and naghdi in these roles so getting viola pantuso and joseph sissens instead was an unexpected bonus for me  they more than met my expectations  pantuso was lovely  youthful  lyrical  very sweet  and sissens was just an absolute star who needs to be promoted to principal asap  the charisma  the panache  the chemistry in his interactions with literally everyone on the stage  promote him   paulina  magri absolutely killed this  acted her ass of and really made this role the highlight of the whole production   hermione  listen you guys i know some of you think marianela is too perfect and clinical but i could not agree less  as i expected she was beautiful  regal  dignified in the face of the horrible humiliation her character endures and pleadingly emotional at her trial  queen   now  a common complaint among the good people at balletco is that the music is unmemorable  which i agree with to an extent  but not entirely  does it have bangers like tchaikovsky ballets  is it catchy like your average adam or minkus ballet  absolutely not  but i think the music is suitably evocative of the mood it tries to convey and i actually do find some bits quite hummable and memorable  so no complaints from me there   one thing i will say is the bear looked a mess  i swear it seemed like a great effect in the      recording  whether something has gone wrong since  it was just an off night  or a particularly good night on the recording  or i m just tripping  i really don t know  plus i swear the bear was upside down     on a different  off topic note  can someone who regularly sees opera at the roh please tell me if it s usual for opera audiences to be way more badly behaved than ballet audiences or if i was just unlucky  bc i saw lucia yesterday and it was a mess  a constant cacophony of coughs  phones going off  drinking and eating sounds  people with their bare feet on the backs of other people s seats during the interval  the mf in front of me leaning forward every single second of the performance and blocking damn near my entire view of the stage  luckily there were empty seats nearby so i could move   like   wow   damn this ended up long as hell lol but what can you do  i m back for a repeat swan lake tonight  since i already reviewed it i ll spare you the fangirling lol and just shoot a quick comment in the weekly thread

tldr  i am a current masters student at a european university  drug development   and i m struggling with the choice of my future niche  i am      sure i want to pursue phd  but i d like to make sure that i keep my options open between both academia and the industry  my choice is between computer aided drug design and computational structural biology molecular mechanics  i m looking for insights about both fields  how they overlap  and what do the career prospects look in both   more info  this is my second masters  my past education and experience is kinda all over the place   i have degrees in biochem  biophysics and bioinfo  my actual research experience is mostly experimental  in physical biochem and biophysics  but it is admittedly a little outdated   it was around    years ago  although it includes university employment    years ago when covid started i moved to clinical trials   with my current choice  i m limited by the research landscape in my region  which will be a lesser issue with phd  when i can actually get paid anything  i am really drawn to the  hardcore science  aspects of this field   quantum chem  theoretical biophysics  algorithm building  i d say i have a very solid understanding of biophysics  medicinal chemistry and molecular biology  i can code  but i d say i get by more than a programming god level  i m also interested in ai methods in this field  but like  more alphafold like approaches than retrosynthesis analysis   in the future  after a phd  ideally i d like to get a postdoc  and then decide between tenure or industry  i don t have issues with teaching or mentorship  but i don t want to work in client patient facing roles anymore  i searched existing job offers  but they seem to focus on  have a degree and some experience  more than specifics  which i think will change in   years i need to graduate  as there s a great interest in this field among my peers   i d like to choose something that maximizes my chances of employment and gives me maximum mobility worldwide   my current choice is      molecular mechanics modeling   no ai  which might or might not include receptor ligand interactions     algorithms for ai in cadd   very compsci based and i m worried i will just waste my biochem biophys knowledge to become a subpar programmer     docking studies   i would have a minimal exposition to any algorithms or theory  i would just use existing  and mostly commercial  software to do docking     quantum chem based ab initio calculations   with a professor literally no one ever met and no one really knows what they do  the lab just publishes reviews recently   i m looking for literally any insight  especially  which methodologies should i learn to maximize my chance of getting a high quality phd  ideally in drug development  reality checks are also very welcome

hi all  just saw a cardiologist for the first time today  he s referred me to a clinic in sydney for a ttt  and said that while he knows nothing about dysautonomia himself he s happy to trial meds with me to see if anything helps my symptoms  said that how i react to stuff will be a helpful clue to diagnosis   initially he prescribed propanolol  but at the end of the appointment as i was paying he came out and said he d spoken with a colleague who s more familiar with dysautonomia  and that colleague recommended i be prescribed midodrine instead  his reasoning for this is that my blood pressure is on the lower end of normal  so he doesn t want it to drop further   i ve been testing my blood pressure and hr every day for two weeks  from what i can tell my bp hovers around        or higher when lying down  but jumps up to        when standing up  i m confused as to whether my standing hr is hypertensive or not based on just google     will midodrine really be fine    apologies if there are other posts already like this  i think i m mostly confused about whether my blood pressure while standing is considered ok or not  he took my pressure while standing at my appointment but didn t really say anything other than  its fine  lol

glycemic load is a measure of how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels  foods with a high glycemic load  such as refined carbohydrates  cause a rapid spike in blood sugar and insulin levels  this can lead to inflammation and an increase in sebum production  both of which are key factors in the development of acne   it s important to note that fructose  a type of sugar found in fruits  has a different pathway than other carbohydrates  fructose needs to be processed by the liver first  but excessive fructose consumption is associated with a higher risk of non alcoholic fatty liver disease  nafld   therefore  it s still important to watch out for excessive fruit intake   other acne pathways affected by carbs  in addition to the glycemic load  there are other ways in which carbohydrates can contribute to acne  these include      gut dysbiosis  excessive carb intake can lead to an overgrowth of candida and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth  sibo   both of which are associated with acne     insulin resistance  high carb diets can lead to insulin resistance  which has been linked to acne     igf    insulin like growth factor    igf    is a hormone that can increase sebum production and contribute to acne  high carb diets can increase igf   levels   low glycemic load diets and acne  several studies have investigated the effects of low glycemic load diets on acne  a randomized clinical trial found that adding a diet with a low glycemic index and low glycemic load for    weeks improved moderate acne  another study found that a low glycemic diet combined with metformin therapy was effective in treating male subjects with acne resistant to common treatments   a randomized controlled trial by smith et al         found that a low glycemic load diet improved symptoms in acne vulgaris patients  a follow up study by the same authors  smith et al         found that a low glycemic load diet also improved the fatty acid composition of skin surface triglycerides   considerations for cutting out carbs  if you re considering cutting out carbs to improve your acne  it s important to ensure that you re getting enough healthy fats in your diet  otherwise  you may feel depleted and experience other negative side effects   another perspective  it s worth noting that not all studies have found a clear link between glycemic index and acne  a trial by reynolds et al         found no difference in acne between groups consuming high and low glycemic index carbohydrates  this could potentially be because macronutrient distribution and fiber content were the same between both groups   conclusion  while more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between diet and acne  the available evidence suggests that consuming a diet low in high glycemic load foods may be beneficial for some individuals with acne  if you re struggling with acne  it may be worth discussing dietary changes with your dermatologist or a registered dietitian  however  it s important to approach any dietary changes in a balanced and sustainable way to ensure overall health and well being   join the discord here    https   discord com invite jjrejuhgc   https   discord com invite jjrejuhgc    blog    https   linen chamois        builder preview com   https   linen chamois        builder preview com  
  the hormone acne link  a recent study published in the journal of clinical medicine research investigated the correlation between hormone levels and acne severity  the study found that there was a significant positive correlation between acne grade and levels of certain hormones  including testosterone  dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate  dheas   and insulin like growth factor    igf            these findings suggest that imbalances in these hormones may contribute to the development and severity of acne  in particular  high levels of androgens like testosterone and dheas can stimulate the production of sebum  the oily substance that can clog pores and lead to acne breakouts     natural remedies for hormonal acne  while there are many pharmaceutical treatments available for hormonal acne  some people may prefer to try natural remedies first  here are some herbs and supplements that may help balance hormone levels and improve skin health      saw palmetto  this herb is often used to reduce levels of dihydrotestosterone  dht   a potent form of testosterone that can contribute to acne     fenugreek  some studies suggest that fenugreek may help increase testosterone levels and improve symptoms related to low testosterone  such as low libido     ashwagandha  this adaptogenic herb is believed to help manage stress and may have a positive impact on testosterone levels     stinging nettle  this plant is thought to help reduce dht levels by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to dht     zinc  this mineral is important for hormone production  and zinc supplementation may help increase testosterone levels  especially in those with a zinc deficiency     vitamin d  often considered a hormone rather than a vitamin  adequate levels of vitamin d are associated with maintaining optimal testosterone levels     green tea extract  contains compounds that are believed to help reduce dht levels  a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled clinical trial found that supplementation with green tea extract improved acne in post adolescent women           dim  diindolylmethane   found in cruciferous vegetables and in supplement form  dim is thought to support the metabolism of estrogen     spearmint tea and vitex  these herbs may be particularly helpful for women with hormonal acne     the role of insulin resistance  in addition to androgens and other sex hormones  insulin resistance may also play a role in the development of acne  research indicates that administration of sex hormones  such as testosterone to females and ethinyl estradiol to males  can induce insulin resistance in healthy subjects        this suggests that both androgens and estrogens can influence insulin sensitivity  although the mechanisms and outcomes may vary   furthermore  a study found that progesterone increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial h o  emission in nonmenopausal women  which is linked to insulin resistance        this suggests that progesterone could play a role in the development of insulin resistance through its effects on mitochondrial function   the combined effects of estrogen and progesterone on insulin resistance are complex and can be influenced by factors such as the method of hormone delivery  oral vs  transdermal  and the presence of other conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome  pcos   some studies suggest that certain combinations of estrogen and progesterone can have neutral or even beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity           conclusion  hormones play a significant role in the development and severity of acne  imbalances in androgens  estrogens  and insulin sensitivity can all contribute to the formation of acne lesions  while there are many pharmaceutical treatments available  some people may prefer to try natural remedies like herbs and supplements to balance hormone levels and improve skin health  as always  it s important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment regimen     references       correlation analysis between hormone level and acne grade  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc        table t      report objectonly      does supplementation with green tea extract improve acne in post adolescent women  a randomized  double blind  and placebo controlled clinical trial  https   pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov                k  h  polderman et al   the journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism  https   pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov               daniel a  kane et al   american journal of physiology  endocrinology and metabolism  https   pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov                christopher p  spencer et al   metabolism  clinical and experimentalthe hormone acne link  https   pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov             join the discord here    https   discord com invite jjrejuhgc   https   discord com invite jjrejuhgc    blog    https   linen chamois        builder preview com   https   linen chamois        builder preview com

question    what to do when tests don t look good after surgery  should we start looking at clinical trials    tldr  my dads ca    numbers look worse than at diagnosis       after surgery         latest scans looked clean   background    my dad was first diagnosed in september      with a borderline resectable tumour  after   rounds of neo adjuvant chemo  nab gem  he had an appleby surgery  with negative margins  in december and spent december   most of january to recover  did   rounds of chemo  nab gem  after the surgery  but in latest test done last week  his ca    rose to higher than pre surgery levels  scans came back clean with no sign of tumour    ca    levels   at diagnosis  around    immediately prior to surgery  december        a week ago  high    s   doctors said it could be due to inflammation  but is prescribing my dad with   more rounds of folfirinox   aside from looking at clinical trials and finding other ways to beat the cancer  should my family be mentally preparing ourselves 
hello  i recently spoke with a member of leapcure  an organization that helps connect patients to clinical trials  they discussed the following information that we wanted to share with the community here    there is a ted clinical trial that is open for patients who are    and over and are dealing with symptoms of ted such as bulging eyes and double vision  if you d like to participate but are unsure if you qualify  that s okay  you can fill out a short questionnaire here and potentially eligible patients will be contacted by a study team member  who will be ready to answer your questions    participants will receive all study related procedures at no cost  you may be eligible for reasonable compensation for your time to attend study visits  you may also be reimbursed for certain approved study related costs  such as transportation  lodging  and meals    note  any personal information you fill out is secure and confidential    link to the short questionnaire   lpcur com rthyroideyedisease  http   lpcur com rthyroideyedisease   i believe that i had previously shared this clinical trial  but this is another link through leapcure so you can connect with them about any trials you may qualify for  they are super responsive if you have any questions about the study or process   the leapcure representative was also nice enough to send along this extensive list of resources that they share with ted patients   https   docs google com document d  ewj ykswulwpnh spv ahagqgc yhwt j ovd j cbe edit  https   docs google com document d  ewj ykswulwpnh spv ahagqgc yhwt j ovd j cbe edit 
adrian ghobrial   published may          a first of its kind canadian research study is working towards a major medical breakthrough for a brain disorder  believed to be caused by repeated head injuries  that can only be detected after death   inside the brain imaging centre at toronto s centre for addiction and mental health  camh   scientific director neil vasdev is hopeful that his team is on the cusp of being able to diagnose chronic traumatic encephalopathy  cte  in a living person   speaking with ctv national news  vasdev shares that   if we can detect cte in life then we can start working towards stopping the disease in its tracks   that would be a game changer for untold thousands across the world   the disorder has increasingly been found in the brains of deceased athletes like football and hockey players  and more recently it has been discovered in military veterans   researchers have found that people with a history of substantial repetitive head impacts  rhi   can experience a buildup of a type of protein around the blood vessels called  tau   a different strain of tau is also found in alzheimer s patients   a concentration of the cte specific tau protein can have life altering cognitive effects on the living by impacting their cognitive ability  which can lead to depression and even suicidal tendencies     a look at the living brain    currently  doctors are unable to diagnose cte in a living patient  though vasdev and his team of canadian scientists at camh are hoping to change that   their work focuses on taking a drug and making it radioactive  known as a tracer  the radioactive drug is injected into a patient who s then placed inside what s called a pet imaging scanner  as the drug travels through an area of the body  doctors can then detect any red flags   simply put  using pet imaging and radioactive drugs  doctors can  look at the living human brain   vasdev explains   vasdev s hope lies in a new radio pharmaceutical  that has been optimized to potentially detect the type of tau protein found in cte  and in the weeks ahead his team will begin a canadian research study on humans to test its effectiveness   for many fighting on the front lines of this brain disorder  it s a positive step  international research director samantha bureau with the concussion legacy foundation tells ctv news that  for those suffering from suspected cte  this study can provide an immense amount of hope  a substantial challenge for those who suspect they may have cte is the uncertainty around the cause of what they are experiencing    the hope is that if successful  this study will open up opportunities for better treatment avenues in the future    the ability to engage in clinical trials to develop treatments that alter disease progression  by either slowing  or in best case scenarios  reversing or clearing the disease  would completely change how we address cte in the clinic   adds bureau   vasdev s research into concussions began more than a decade ago when he was working at harvard university   he shares his belief that  significant strides have been made for looking at alzheimer s disease tau  but cte tau protein is different because no two head injuries are the same and it s often found in much younger people    for vasdev  it s a project of passion  his mother is a canadian military veteran who enlisted in the     s  at the time  she was one of the only east indian women in the army  she has dedicated her brain to cte research  vasdev is hoping his work will help his mother  veterans and canadians from all walks of life   vasdev believes that having the ability to diagnose cte in life  means we could immediately start working towards prevention strategies  treatment regimens and ultimately stopping the disease

hello  i am a scribe ambassador with sa  i work with a medical oncologist whose notes are    frankly crazy  she includes the entire chronology of symptoms and all interventions she has recommended for every issue a patient has  she copies her previous note forwards  so it s not  as  bad as it sounds   but navigating her notes and writing for her is sometimes a nightmare    i am moving on to a clinical trial coordinator position in july and sa has found a replacement for me    who speaks english as a second language  she makes spelling mistakes with layman s english and has no grasp on medical terminology  to make matters worse   she is the most timid human being i have ever encountered and apologizes for making mistakes  rather than asking questions to improve    we have had   in person training sessions and  while she has improved  it has been at a snails pace  if she progresses at her current rate   it would be better for my doctor not to have a scribe when i leave    management has  as always  been useless in navigating this  wtf do i do  i had a phone call with my doc just now and she said  frankly i will not take her as your replacement    i don t have the authority to tell her she s fired  i m just lost  advice 
today i turned in my final assignment for my phd program    of course  i m nowhere near done  i still have comps  dissertation  running my pis clinical trial  defense  and proposal writing for like   more years    but at least no more homework 
so i ve been in clinical research for three years now doing ap and ar and i m starting to realize  after being with two different companies  that maybe i just despise what i do   little background  one company was a major corporation that dealt and catered mainly to the big drug companies and the other company is a small company that mainly advocates for better terms and conditions for the doctors participating in drug trials   as for me  i m     live in america  have a b s  in accounting  i came from doing construction work  and a little bit of retail  and have been in clinical research since finishing my degree in       i love working remote as my wife is also remote so we get to spend a little more time together  there is no commute  and we re free to live pretty much wherever we d like  and i m aware that work is work  i just don t think work should make you miserable  stressed  and furious on a daily basis   anyone have any suggestions for what i could potentially try for a new career move   thanks 
hello   i am a    m who is a      bba and      medical school graduate  i have worked several years in basic  academic  and clinical trial research  most recently i was working in a pathology laboratory  i have just taken a new position which starts in two weeks as a lecturer in a physician assistant program at a small school in rural western pa  i also want to pursue my mba at the same time as in the future i envision myself having some sort of leadership role within a healthcare organization or maybe even a clinical trial manager position within a pharma or cro  my ug gpa was a laughable     but i was fortunate enough to get into usd and unl  i want to start in the summer term  literally next week  while i work full time and wanted some advice input about either program  the appeal to usd is that it has a healthcare admin focus but unl carries a little more weight as far as brand names go  thanks in advance for your help 
hey  m  here about to go into our first summer  and everyone i know is scrambling for research  although i know not everyone does research over the summer and it s not required for all specialities  i was thinking of doing something  through a familial connection i may have an opportunity to do some research help work on phase   clinical trials for pharmaceuticals  however  i m hesitant to take the potential opportunity since i feel it would be more relevant to a pharm student and not a med student  and would not be especially helpful to me  am i wrong    also i m interested in pm r so it s not especially related to that field either lol   thoughts 
this post is not for advice  this is an  offmychest post  off my chest  a confession of sorts  you can have an opinion but your input on the validity of my love or our relationship will fall on deaf ears because i m not leaving him  so sorry  but i m not at all sorry  this is my man  mine  my relationship  mine  you don t know him  you don t know us  and you don t know everything about everyone because you read a few paragraphs that i decided to getoffmychest   my boyfriend is traumatized by almost dying two years ago    this is a chronic health condition that went undiagnosed and nearly killed him  he was hospitalized for weeks  and the doctors warned he could have potential brain damage  he lived  thankfully  but it took him about a year to fully recover  in that year he continued to take good care of me    his dad died a year ago     of the same condition that almost took my boyfriend  we ve been together for almost   years  so i was around for all of it  i was with his family when we were told that my boyfriend might not make it and i was there with him when his dad took his last breath       context     edit    for about a year he s been depressed  before that  i was the depressed mess and he helped me through it  i got into therapy and on meds with his help  he s always been incredibly devoted to me and giving in our relationship  he s always been willing to pick up my slack when i needed it  and vice versa  he gave me his car  he paid for my tuition when i needed it  he helped me flee my abusive home life  anything i ve ever said i wanted i ve gotten from him  this is the longest that i ve ever had to pick up his slack and i don t know what to do  he s always been good at bouncing back after being low but this time is different   he s so deeply depressed that i ve been taking care of everything  i do all of our cooking   make everything from scratch and modify for his dietary needs  all of our cleaning  i take notice of when he s running low on things he needs and make sure to get them before he runs out   i remind him to shower and brush his teeth  we have   pets that i do all of the care for  these are all things i m willing and able to do because i love him more than life  we aren t married  but i date to marry and i view this as a trial that we can and will overcome  the key word here  is we  if he wears dirty clothes  his confidence plummets and the low gets lower  if he doesn t eat well he doesn t have enough energy to work affectively  everything i do is helping him spend time on his hobbies  when he has the energy and will to do so    i ve been diagnosed with clinical depression  cptsd  general anxiety disorder  and ocd  i know what it s like to be depressed  i have survived a few attempts myself and i understand how dark it can get  the issue here isn t that he s depressed  it s that he s unwilling to do any work to try to help himself  i m in therapy  on medication and i work hard to keep myself afloat  but i couldn t have done it without his dedication and support even through his own struggles    he has    given me his car when mine broke down  he gets a ride to work from a coworker every day    paid for my tuition when i felt like i needed to go back to school     invested time and money into even the slightest of my interests  from losing weight to video games  books  anything i show even a little interest in he ll do anything to show he s paying attention and is supportive of it    helped me realize that i was being abused by my mother  the second he realized he got me out of it  he moved me into his family home  he held my hand while i called cps on my own mother  and spent   weeks helping me clean out my mother s hoarder home she had abandoned in the aftermath      my sister is important to me so she s important to him  at one point  i was going for guardianship  and he opened up a high yield savings account to invest into my sister s future       when i was depressed  and my medication journey was crazy  he washed my hair when i asked because it felt comforting and it was too exhausting to do myself  even now  at his lowest  he tries to show his love by surprising me with things i ll like    i could go on and on and on and on about the ways he s been here for me   even his family is starting to tell me i need to walk away  that he doesn t have the drive that i do  i don t believe that  i know him  they re the ones who instilled into him that it was  weak  and  admitting defeat  to need therapy  and that medication for mental health was useless and poison     years of telling him he is simply broken is going to make it really hard for someone to accept that they don t have to be broken  i know he s in there  and stronger than any of them by just waking up in the morning  my family thinks i m working too hard for someone who s not working on himself and my friends aren t supportive of my willingness to  do all of this for a man  but he s my man  even a post here on reddit asking for advice on more ways to support him was just filled with comments that i need to walk away because i m sacrificing too much    i don t believe that there is too much sacrifice for love  the last thing i ll do is walk away from him 
i know y all like shouty ai generated dd full of bad analogies  but let s try something different   prokidney   prok  is a pharma company that is developing a new cell therapy treatment for chronic kidney disease called react  about   m americans have kidney disease  and about   m live with kidney failure  so it s very common and there is a lot of money in treatment   just look at the   b market cap of dva  a dialysis company   prok has made it through phase   and is preparing to start phase   of clinical trials but their manufacturing is on pause right now due to an audit of its quality management  they have brought in some new executives and are working on expanding operations over the next few years and opening new facilities in nc with the support of greensboro and winston salem  they say they have enough capital to survive through the end of the       but plan on start manufacturing again  mid           bear case    the bear case is pretty straightforward  they are not able to start manufacturing again or they start manufacturing again but the phase   results disappoint  this is certainly a possibility and a big risk  there is not a lot of news that comes out about the company and it s hard to tell if they are on schedule  there is a real danger they could burn through their cash and go bk     bull case    the short term bull case is that they start manufacturing again in the next few months  this positive news could be a catalyst that brings buyers  a longer term bull case is that they not only fix their quality issues and start manufacturing again  but also have positive stage   results  this could     x in the next   years if things go right     price    about a month ago  the price shot up on no news  i think this got picked up by some short screener algos and some pharma tracking sites  however  i don t think this is any kind of squeeze play so i don t even want to speak to short interest  the play here is primarily that positive news comes out in the next few months   also  it s worth noting that the options for this ticker are not very liquid  there is at least an option chain so you can try to grab contracts  but don t bid ask spreads are huge and you won t move anything quickly   earnings are tomorrow  so hopefully they provide some positive updates about their production     disclosure    i am long prok  i am holding shares             calls  and            calls  i plan on rolling those contracts forward until there is some news  i see this as a true bet with high risk and high upside       tldr  prok is a pharma company on a manufacturing pause and may either go under or see a big upside if they can start up production again 
i m   m  based in the uk  i do not have a degree  my experience has been in retail entry level office jobs  i have been unemployed for the past two years  before then i worked two jobs for many years before deciding to travel for a long period of time   what i want to make as much money as possible within the next   years before moving abroad   at the moment i am living on the little amount of savings i have left   since my intention is to earn as much money as possible within the next   years  i do not see going to university as an ideal option at the moment since it will take up at least   years  not to mention the cost  i have been applying to night shift retail hospitality jobs  and i live a very frugal lifestyle  i try to make some extra money by doing online surveys focus groups  even clinical trials etc   is there anything else someone can recommend suggest i do 
yo  i have recently been looking into promino nutritional sciences and cant help but think they are undervalued at a   m mc  they ve developed a plant based protein formula that s reportedly twice as effective as whey protein and are coming out with ready to drink products by next year   they ve got pretty major endorsements from big names like jos  bautista and jack eichel  which is obviously super impressive for a company of this size  the market for health and wellness supplements has been doing super well so with a patented formula backed    clinical trials  it seems like they ve got potential to at least grab a slice of the    b market which would obviously bring the share price many muplties higher   just interested to see if anyone else has these guys on their watchlist   also  they just interestingly announced today that they are initiating preclinical studies focused on their product s potential to prevent muscle loss in cancer patients which could be huge   any input or thoughts are welcome

 disclaimer  i eat a keto vegan diet  i have heart disease  clogged arteries and other health issues  i m really questioning why to eat vegan recently   i m having trouble  getting past this and have been for almost a year now  caldwell esselstyn  dean ornish  joel kahn and other cardiologists say to do vegan diets  and often very low fat and with lots of healthy grains  many of them  dean ornish and esselstyn  have done clinical trials to prove this saves lives  and they often site how other cultures and countries and time periods didn t have heart disease   what i struggle with is      the studies are always compared to a standard american diet  which is the equivalent of studying a race between animal types and pitting a turtle  the sad diet  against a human runner  yes  the race shows that the human is faster  but concluding that humans are the fastest animal based on that race is silliness  did you race humans against cheetahs  or horses  no  then all you proved is that turtles  the sad diet  doesn t perform well      these cardiologists mention other cultures  time periods and countries that don t   didn t have high heart disease rates  or any in some cases   and they completely ignore japan and the inuit  which are fish based  the blue zones documentary guy wrote a book and talks about all of these different countries with different eating habits and lesser disease and concludes vegan is the way to go  despite just telling us that in japan they eat a ton of fish  to keep with the race metaphor  it s like saying humans are the fastest and then doing a race between a turtle  sloth  crab  some other slow animals  horses  cheetahs and humans  and when the humans come in third  saying that they beat out all animals other than horses and cheetahs  and we can t explain the humans not winning  but ignore it  humans are the fastest animals on land anyways  horses and cheetahs are an unexplained phenomenon but trust us  humans are fastest   i keep thinking i m missing something  but keep coming back to the above two points  a vegan  whole foods based diet clearly saves lives but does it save more lives than a diet with some fish would  is extra virgin olive oil and healthy fats really a problem  is grass fed beef really bad for you   is the mercury in fish the problem with fish and if not for that  a seafood plant based whole food diet would be best  i m fine with that being the answer  but then would like to hear vegan diets discussed in that context instead of acting like they re superior  i d also like to hear of some trials where plant based keto diets were compared to plant based low fat diets  and grass fed beef   mercury free salmon diets compared to vegan low fat diets   apologies if this is coming across as a rant  i m struggling with high oxalates lately  despite eating chia seeds every day  and i m re evaluating my diet  also listening to podcasts with lots of cardiologists and struggling to not turn them off the second i hear mention of other countries in the context of vegan diets and heart disease and no mention of france and japan or non sad diets   i m mostly wondering if i m alone in questioning the logic on vegan diets  and if i m missing something 
  stem cell therapy improves post stroke motor function    patrice wendling  may           chicago   early results from a first in human trial some    years in the making suggest that neural stem cell transplantation is safe and improves motor function starting at   month after treatment in patients with chronic ischemic stroke   almost all patients saw some improvement in the primary efficacy outcome of change in total fugl meyer motor score  at    months  eight of    patients had an improvement of      points   considered   clinically meaningful     and three other patients reached this threshold earlier    patients improved at   month  increased at   months   were  stable at   months  and then we saw something we never saw in any of the prior trials we ve done in transplant patients   and that is increased recovery between   and    months  an       point  improvement on average  from     points at   months    said investigator gary k  steinberg  md  phd  co director of the stanford stroke center  stanford university school of medicine  california   the findings were presented on may   at the american association of neurological surgeons  aans       annual meeting     limited treatment options    except for vagal nerve stimulation  vns  with intensive rehabilitation  which gained us food and drug administration  fda  approval in       there is currently no treatment to restore loss of function in patients with chronic ischemic stroke   steinberg and his colleagues developed a   human embryonic derived neural stem cell product  nr  cells       years ago  preclinical data in different models from their lab and others have shown that stem cell transplantation can enhance stroke recovery   twenty years later  the fda gave the greenlight for the current  phase    a study  https   www clinicaltrials gov study nct          in humans   the    patients were aged         years   and were   months to   years out from an ischemic subcortical middle cerebral stroke  they had a modified rankin score of     and stable motor deficit  and they had been through rehabilitation  patients with a stroke lesion     cc or       cc on mri were excluded   the nr  stem cells were delivered through a burr hole and stereotactically injected into the subcortical peri infarct area while patients were awake  the   open label    dose escalation treatment              and    million cells  included tacrolimus immunosuppression for   weeks  physical therapy was encouraged but not required     the final patient will be transplanted in may         steinberg said   patients had an average score increase of     points on the lower extremity motor fugl meyer assessment  fma  at    months  which was statistically significant   the upper extremity fma score also increased significantly  by an average of     points    that s better than the vagal nerve stimulation trial showed of     points on average at    days and our patients were worse   steinberg said   the fugl meyer motor upper extremity  score  was    to    to get into the vagal nerve trial  that would have meant only five of our patients would have been included    significant gains were also seen with the stem cell therapy in    meter gait speed and participation in activities of daily living  measured by the barthel index     surprisingly  there was no correlation between clinical response and dose  age  sex  time of stroke to transplant  or stroke volume    steinberg said   further follow up will be conducted to confirm these results and investigate mechanisms of recovery  he said  a prospective  multicenter double blind phase  b study is also being planned      idling  circuits theory    if confirmed  the findings  are  very  very important   steinberg told medscape medical news because  until recently  it was believed that there s no recovery after   months because the patient s circuits are dead  this study seems to contradict that    so  this was a paradigm shift and we ve shown this in some other studies injecting into the brain   steinberg said   the circuits  i believe  are idling  and my theory is that they are suppressed by chronic inflammation and that somehow putting the cells in   maybe the needle has a role   releases the circuits so they can function and it catalyzes a recovery      you don t need the cells to survive long term  they just need to release their factors  and  stimulate this system    they jazz up the circuits  and now the circuits function again  it may be very important to combine it with physical therapy  as the vns trial did   added steinberg   adverse events among the    patients transplanted thus far included incisional pain or headache in most patients  nausea  fatigue  transient worsened speech in three patients  and asymptomatic chronic subdural hygroma in two patients   the events were very minor  all resolved spontaneously  none were related to the cells  and all were related to the surgical procedure  steinberg said  no severe adverse events requiring hospitalization occurred in the first year     cautious optimism    commenting on the findings for medscape medical news  jonathan russin  md  associate professor of neurological surgery at the university of southern california  pasadena  was cautious about interpreting what the study s results might mean    this sort of pivotal trial for the first in human stem cells for stroke represents a large body of work  but i don t think there s a lot of conclusions we can draw until it s done   he said   in terms of possibly better upper limb mobility with stem cell therapy than was observed in the vns trial  russin said that phase   safety trials often enroll patients with the least to lose    they re going to add another patient to the trial  and then they ll have to present us with the final analysis   he said   i m excited though  cautiously excited     the study was supported by grants from the national institutes of health national institute of neurological disorders and stroke and from the california institute for regenerative medicine  steinberg reports royalties from peter lazic us and serving as a consultant for sanbio  zeiss  and surgical theater  russin reports having no financial relationships to disclose    https   www medscape com viewarticle stem cell therapy improves post stroke motor function     a

by lunchtime  the payroll office had revolted    three administrators sat in the hallway of the ancient hydro building  pissed off  and waiting for me to arrive   within a few metres of their door  i could already smell what this was about    it d happened again  a dead thing above the ceiling tiles  the guy i d replaced as union rep  a custodian named charles  had told me the story of a dead squirrel the managers refused to believe existed above the payroll office  going so far as to deny the foul stench making everybody sick    they gave in  eventually   the previous rep told me on his last day   but it was awkward  the custodians  including me  refused to do it  managers probably didn t want to piss them off  never piss off a custodian  brother  or man      he didn t have to tell me  i d been in elementary school the last time the custodians in bridal veil lake public service went on strike  little ten year old me was up to my ankles in trash by the end of the week   but i digress  charles had retired  and the ladies of payroll were the union members that needed my help    we re not going back in there  hal   cristi said  she d worked with hydro since her teenage years and could retire anytime or take a year off sick with all her banked days  she was also the only one who understood the complexity of the antiquated system hydro used to pay everyone  in other words  she was bulletproof to the managers  all younger than her   i went to her direct manager next  i was new to the union rep job  i wasn t new to hydro  i d been with the company as a training specialist going on fifteen years   basically  i spent most of my day writing instructions and delivering programs to employees  i knew everybody and felt pretty comfortable    payroll is in the hallway again   i said  seated opposite the project manager  geoff  and  surprisingly  fred  the head custodian   there s a smell  again    the two of them exchanged a glance    hal   geoff eventually said   there s no smell in there  it s    he looked to fred  who nodded    cristi hates me   fred said with a shrug   i would never refuse something like that  it s an easy fix  i just don t want to deal with her  she thinks she rules the place  and    geoff raised his hand   it s a conflict of personalities     and a smell   i added   there s definitely a smell  geoff  i smelled it  everyone can smell it     it s an old building   fred said   probably a water leak has gone stagnant in the tiles  i sent jj to look  and he couldn t find anything  there s no dead animal     it really smells like there is    he wasn t wrong about the building though  it s super old  nikola tesla helped design it after he d finished in niagara falls and turned the lights on in hamilton  that was in         bridal veil lake got their mini version of hydroelectric ac power the following year  the only older building that i know of is buchner collegiate  the high school  which served as a barracks and hospital during the war of         and that building has been renovated and updated so many times  you d only know its age by the clues in the few remaining fragments still standing    the westinghouse power station  on the other hand  looks like a castle  inside and out  all of the modern equipment looks out of place  and the drop ceilings are comical  why put cheap garbage overtop of supposedly amazing stone masonry    maybe to catch all the leaks and piss off cristi in payroll  i guess    we can replace the tiles  hal   geoff said  a little exhausted   but it won t fix cristi     does cristi need fixing    he quickly shook his head   no  i mean  the thing with the custodians  she always seems to have a problem they can t fix fast enough    it wasn t my job to comment or care about his opinion of cristi   when will the tiles be replaced    fred appeared to awaken from slumber   this evening     and in the meantime    the manager sighed   payroll can work from home this afternoon    i thanked them and brought the good news to cristi and the others  she didn t seem as happy as her younger colleagues  but didn t comment  they held their breath to retrieve their things and went home    it felt like a victory until cristi s brief and concerned look on her way out of the giant  ponderous doors to the parking lot  she opened her mouth to say something  but thought better of it  i guess  and smiled and waved at me in farewell   job done  or so i thought   the smell persisted  geoff said fred was waiting on some replacement tiles  he d taken out the ones above the door  which were the apparent source of the issue  yet  it still stank like death   geoff could only shrug  i think he was happy with cristi working from home for a few more days  she could be pushy and authoritative  but i liked her  plus  she had earned her unofficial leadership role through pure grit    most of the managers  on the other hand  have nice last names and relatives in high places around town  geoff s dad served as city manager  everyone knew hydro was just the waiting room for a shithead like geoff    by friday  the awful odour had spread  moving down the steps to the purchasing department  no argument was required this time  they were all sent home early for the weekend  a bunch of people began wishing the stink would somehow flow their way   fred viewed the spread as confirmation of his foul water theory  after another rainy day  the leak had overrun whatever cavity it d filled in the ceiling  gravity  he reasoned  and demonstrated with his hands representing the ceiling for some reason  had pulled the excess water to the ceiling above purchasing     wouldn t the water have to breach the second floor  uh  floor   i asked    it s an old building   he affirmed for me again    yes     water gets into a place  it s gonna travel down if it can   he scratched his grizzled beard  and i recognized the beginning of a pointless conversation    see ya fred    more tiles were ordered  and he d get jj up on the roof monday   case closed   i d spent too much time with this issue  and found the need to clock some overtime on saturday  i didn t mind because i got paid for it  when i rolled into the parking lot around ten am  i was surprised to see cristi s car   the lights were on in payroll  i had a lot to catch up on  so avoided going to visit with her first  she d come to me  for sure  once she realized i was in  and another tirade about fred and geoff and the state of the power station would raise the unasked question  why not retire   around     she finally passed by the window of my office  she waved and smiled but didn t stop to chat and seemed in an uncharacteristic hurry  usually  cristi approached everything  quite literally  with quiet resolve and certainty  it was weird to see her nervously wringing her hands    i peeked into the wide hallway as her echoing footsteps ceased by the elevator  she pressed the call button going up  no official reason to be going to the second floor  where a bunch of crap no one knew what to do with was stored    old equipment and boxes of work orders filled those rooms  and all of it smelled like dirt because some genius thought it d be cool to carpet over the stone hallways  rather than rip up the carpets  the next genius decided to relocate the executive offices downtown   after the elevator elevated away  i snuck up the stairs  thinking i d give her a surprise  she d be pissed but not for long    cristi was serious most of the time  and yet not above the odd prank  she d engineered a jump scare on the other payroll folks last halloween with a huge  remote control tarantula    i stopped at the final step to the second floor when i heard her talking   this is stupid  this is stupid  i should just  oh god  it s definitely coming from    the rest of her words were lost beneath the heavy chonk of an old tumbler lock  i crouched before i peeked around the edge of the stairwell wall  cristi held a large  brass key  and braced herself against the room ahead  she held her nose against the back of her hand  and after a moment  i smelt why   the awful smell came from that room  there could be no doubt  fred s theory about stagnant water flowing from the roof on down through the floors was wrong  something had died up ahead  it was so bad  i gagged  and the odour filled my mouth with a rancid taste   despite my extreme revulsion  cristi went in  i tried to call out for her to wait but the words died in my constricted throat  silence followed her entry  the urge to leave persisted  nobody should enter such a room without serious ppe    but i couldn t leave cristi on her own  that would be wrong  i was the rep    so i followed  against every instinct telling me to run  the fear prickling my skin  driving cold sweat through my pores  was about more than a bad smell  there were too many irregularities  something bad had happened in that room   cristi had activated the flashlight app on her phone  in her other hand  she held a bloodied knife    a yelp escaped between the fingers of my hand as i covered my mouth  cristi turned and the light blinded me to everything but the knife    hal   she whispered  only mildly surprised   what are you doing here     i couldn t answer  i watched the blood drip from the tip of the knife into the dark and smelly carpet    hal  hal    i started to back away before i decided to run     what are you doing  hal    i bolted  cristi shouted something  i leapt to the first landing of the stairs  i m not a jogger but cristi s old and wore heels  the worst shoes imaginable for a murderous pursuit   her shrieks echoed in the stairwell  chasing me out into the first floor corridor  i needed my phone  the door to my office was closed and locked  i don t remember if i shut it or not but the handle is always locked    i didn t fuck around with keys  cristi was coming  slowly  and if she had already killed somebody  even an animal   hopefully an animal   she had one more notch in her belt than i  i hadn t even been in a fight since i was a kid  and i certainly lost that one   away from the hallway  toward payroll in fact  i didn t notice the puddle beneath the exposed ceiling tiles  glass from the office window shattered from the impact of my shoulder as i slipped wildly     holy shit  hal  are you okay   fred asked  suddenly there with geoff  they were walking out of geoff s office together  half embedded in the window  i declined to answer   why were you running  what the hell is all over the floor      it s blood   i said  completely out of breath from the run and panic   cristi  she s right behind me  she    should have caught up by now     jesus  what s going on  hal    geoff stepped carefully around the pool of blood growing steadily beneath a steady drip from the ceiling  he looked where i d been running   is cristi with you     no  no  you don t understand   i said as fred helped dislodge me from the window   she s done something awful upstairs  i think     except that didn t make much sense  why draw attention to the smell with complaints if she caused the smell in the first place  the blood on the knife had been fresh   fred and geoff exchanged a look     why are you guys here   i asked    overtime   they said in unison    why are you here  hal   geoff asked  his eyes narrowed with suspicion    same reason as you     a moment of awkward silence and cleared throats followed    cristi finally stepped out of the stairwell where she d been hiding  she still held the knife     cristi   geoff said   what the hell are you doing   he gestured vaguely at the knife and smirked   fred appeared more incredulous   i knew you were crazy     it s hal   cristi said   i caught him on the second floor  going to the room above payroll     caught me   i said   i followed you there  and you already had that bloody knife  that literally bloody knife  caught me  caught you    i was surprised by my anger  and still scared  it was weird how fred and geoff just happened to be there  cristi too    is that true  cristi  did you go up first    geoff had taken on a typical paternalistic manager voice nobody loved  he s younger than all of us     i did   she admitted   i wanted to see what the hell stank so bad  well  there s something there alright  i couldn t find out what exactly before hal surprised me     i was trying to surprise you   i said   i thought it d be a funny prank    she stared me down  i looked away    hold on   geoff said   fred  didn t you check up there last week when it started smelling again    fred s already ruddy skin turned a deeper shade of red   i was going to send jj up monday  remember  why are you here  geoff   fred tapped his barrel chest   i have a reason to be here     which is   i asked  cristi chose that moment as some kind of invitation to come closer  i leveled a finger at her   don t fucking move     she froze   fuck you  hal    geoff sighed and looked at fred   which is     i bought some tiles for the ceiling   he said   on my own time  with my own money  i wanted to replace the tiles now  so none of the custodians had to deal with cristi      and fuck you  fred   cristi said     i was here to catch up on work   i offered   because the goddamn smell issue took up so much time  we re still waiting for geoff s reason    he shrugged   and you ll keep waiting  i don t have to explain anything to you  i m the boss  remember    cristi laughed and mimed a curtsy  waving the knife around too casually for my liking   my liege     this is fucked up   i said   time to call the police     whoa   geoff said   wait a second  we don t even know what s up there  cristi didn t see anything    i pointed to the knife in her hands     i found it there  hal  i only picked it up in case there were any lurkers around   she crossed her arms  expertly folding the tip of the knife through the crook of her elbow to avoid cutting herself   and there was  so    geoff showed some guts and stepped in the path between me and cristi   just stop  we re probably squabbling over nothing  let s all take a breath  and then go upstairs and see what we re actually dealing with before we execute someone for murder     he didn t want the police involved  anything that got in the way of his progress in daddy s footsteps must be avoided    fred chimed in   he s right  let s just go upstairs  and see    cristi tipped the scale completely   fine     but you leave the knife here   i didn t want to go  there had to be something in our contract excusing workers from walking into possibly criminal circumstances    if i didn t follow the group  however  i felt like i d be drawing suspicion from the others  cristi seemed to think i was guilty of whatever occurred on the second floor    i knew it wasn t me  all of us at work on a saturday was too convenient  geoff had given no reason for his attendance  fred had a reason  a fairly plausible one   avoiding cristi   but was a little too quick to agree to go upstairs  cristi had literally been caught with the murder weapon  if indeed a murder had taken place    i want my phone   i said    sure   geoff said   let s get it together  all of us  cristi  the knife    he held out his hand and took a few steps toward her   she chuckled   fat chance  nepo baby   the knife slid surprisingly far on the smooth stone floor with what seemed like a gentle toss by cristi  it sailed across access to the stairwell  our proposed destination  inviting the guilty party to go and retrieve it   nobody moved  we hesitated  why  we all suspected the others  i knew  especially  the chances of something upstairs being fucked up  even if it was dead animal  were high  i admit i was afraid   they all watched through the open blinds of my office while i retrieved my cell phone  i dropped my keys when i tried to unlock the door  and felt their scrutiny heat up the corridor  i hadn t done anything  i had nothing to do with the rot on the second floor  yet  i took a share of the doubt equally    i guess that was fair  as we mounted the steps in stiff pairs  moving slowly  trying to watch each other and up ahead  i wondered how well i knew any of them  not well enough to be certain they weren t capable of horrible things   cristi s perfume mixed with geoff s liberal use of axe body spray  fred bore a layer of sweat that accentuated a normally subdued body odour  the melange caused a sting in my nostrils  early signs of a headache to come    but i missed the olfactory mixture the second we stepped onto the second floor  the pungent stench of death made us flinch and hesitate  we covered our faces and breathed through our mouths    the dark room exuded silence in addition to dread    i do not want to go in there   i said  mouthing the words through my fingers    me neither   fred agreed   cristi kept her thoughts to herself  and i noticed she had allowed us to move ahead while she lingered closest to the exit    it sucks   geoff agreed   but we need to do this     do we   i asked  i had my phone ready   he saw it and became alarmed   please  don t  look  you re all right about me  okay  i m a  what cristi said     nepo baby   she reminded him   geoff grimaced   but i still care about my career  and my family  if this is nothing  and we call the police  my dad will find out  you know how small bridal veil lake is  everyone knows everyone  i ll look like a fool if i let something dumb slide  something i should have been on top of  you know  my dad already thinks i m     he let us fill in the blank    a chump   cristi filled in     he s not   fred intervened   and you know what  cristi    cristi waited calmly for the answer   but fred balked and wilted the same as geoff   enough   he said   i ll look    to their credit  both fred and geoff entered the room  i d gotten closer than i had on my first visit to the second floor  the carpet squished softly beneath their steps    a trail of blood had already been tracked out by cristi from before  i only noticed it then  however  while fred cursed about the light switch not being beside the door    what are we walking through   geoff asked  neither had turned on a flashlight  they searched blindly  an idea that frankly scared the hell out of me   they weren t scared  however  because maybe they already knew what to expect   sudden illumination painted the horror with clinical track light precision  a flood of red dyed the tacky carpet  swells of blood gathered around geoff s feet    no   fred shouted  i couldn t see him   no  i didn t  i didn t     geoff rapidly tapped on the screen of his phone  i reached instinctively for cristi  afraid  and forgetting about the bloody knife  she stepped ahead  she held another weapon  an exacto blade  extended     come on  coward   she ordered me   fred grunted and whimpered inside the room     jesus fuck   cristi said when she stepped in  she lowered the exacto knife and waited    what is it   i asked her   what     she ignored me and continued to watch a still unseen fred as he laboured desperately over something    stepping into there  onto that  felt like trespassing  i didn t belong there  none of us did  and now that we had there was no returning to the normal world   dried onion skins littered the floor by the wall where fred stood  they crushed and flattened beneath his boots as he desperately attempted to wipe the wall with his hands    written in blood  his name  fred  not frederick  no surname  just f r e d in large print     yes  that s right   geoff said to a     operator   westinghouse     no    fred rounded on us with wild eyes and red hands   it wasn t  i didn t  i    his ass splashed in the sodden carpet as he sat down    he saw the strips of onion surrounding him  we were all so stunned  we looked at them more closely too  aside from the massive amount of blood and the name on the wall  the crisped bits were the only remaining objects of interest    cristi picked up a piece and squinted   what is it     put it down   geoff said  still on the phone   yes  we will   he said to the operator before addressing us again   out  everyone out  stop touching everything     it s skin   cristi said  ignoring geoff  letting the paperthin flesh drift gently to the floor   someone s been cooking up here   why did she seem fascinated   i turned away and saw the clump of bloodied hair before the scalp it was attached too   oh god   i started vomiting  on my hands and knees  sucking in the stink  knowing its origin  an infinite retch held me captive   i crawled out into the hallway   i had to get away    one of them had done something awful to a human being  geoff and cristi followed shortly after  i hardly noticed  fred remained inside the room until sirens could be heard  then he sprang from the doorway and darted into the hall    hold your horses   cristi shouted  stepping into his path  she brandished the exacto blade but to no purpose  fred clocked her straight between the eyes  and the old lady dropped cold  a bag of bones    geoff and i made no effort to prevent fred s escape  i was in no condition to even stand up  geoff is just a prick    the first constables found us as cristi began to awaken  none of us could explain what had happened  and certainly not what had transpired in the bloody room    so they told us  eventually   someone had been murdered there    that much would be confirmed later when i was taken into custody and questioned  the amount of blood suggested to me multiple victims but the body apparently contains an astonishing amount    only one person had died there  charles  the retired custodian  the rep i had replaced   or so the police assumed  further investigation discovered charles missing long enough that the food in his fridge had spoiled  they never found his remains but the blood in the room  and leaking below  belonged to him  no one can lose that much blood and still be alive    he was peeled slowly   a particularly cruel detective told me  trying to get me to admit to killing charles  i guess   it must have been fucking horrible  watching your skin come off  and cooked too  we think they used a lighter  there were bite marks in some of the pieces  hal  grotesque stuff    that was my last interview and then they abruptly told me to leave    fred had been found  he d run to the gorge and hung himself from a tree with his belt a few hours after running from the power station  in his blood  the tip of his finger opened with a sharp stick  he wrote a simple confession on a receipt  i did it   the paper was found in his rotting hand  it had taken the police an embarrassing amount of time to find him  their excuse was he d gone to a remote part of the forest  a nature preserve  where there were no maintained paths   now do you believe fred s confession  no  well  you ll be shocked to know the case effectively closed after his death  officially  fred wasn t charged  no trial followed  but the cruel detective i mentioned earlier was pretty candid about the continuance of the investigation    not bloody likely   he said    i actually ran into him by chance at a bar  not a slim chance either  i visited all the bars after this incident  so did geoff  i ran into him too    we drank together for a few days and then ended up in a fistfight that saw us banned from the lucky snail off tour hill  he accused me  i accused him  neither of us could look at each other once we had no choice but to return to westinghouse   cristi was back before either of us but didn t seem the same  she chose to gradually retire  winding down her hours while she trained a replacement  when i did see her  which was rare  we didn t speak or make eye contact   mostly  i sat in my office and drank  watching the door    fred hadn t done it  were we meant to believe he signed his name in the victim s blood on the wall  or that the victim had somehow written it before dying  fred would have then removed the remains but somehow missed the clumsy accusation     not bloody likely   i say like the cruel detective  a lot  to my braced office door  the killer wanders these halls  i m sure of it    i pee in a bucket because i refuse to go out of my office except to leave the building    i carry a knife   geoff never got his promotion  i still don t really know why he d been in the building that saturday  pulling some bullshit overtime for the extra money  cleaning up his horror show  both  fucking psychopath on the public dime   or maybe not   jj became the new head custodian and the rep  he never found the tiles fred had purchased   that s about the state of things now  i wait for the neat bow to end this ordeal but that s rarely how life works out    things happen to us  we continue living   the villains get away    we pretend they didn t   there s a room of horrors waiting somewhere for you and everyone   it s only a matter of time before you re shaken out of everyday life by it    the best anyone can hope for is to not be peeled  cooked  and  eaten  https   www reddit com u

also statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity  no cases of pdss have been reported to date  after administration of approximately     of the target injection number   an estimated     million people are currently diagnosed with schizophrenia in the u s  it is a chronic  progressive  and severely debilitating mental disorder that affects how one thinks  feels and behaves  currently  there is no long acting olanzapine treatment option available for schizophrenia that does not risk post injection delirium sedation syndrome  pdss   pdss is characterized by the sudden and unexpected onset of delirium or sedation within the first several hours of receiving treatment and has been associated with the intramuscular injection of long acting olanzapine    these encouraging results from the efficacy portion of our phase   solaris trial demonstrate the potential of tev      to be an effective long acting treatment option for schizophrenia and further show our dedication to advancing innovative science in mental health and beyond   said eric hughes  md  phd  executive vice president of global r d and chief medical officer at teva    schizophrenia can be a devastating disease for both the people struggling with it as well their families  schizophrenia is often a chronic life long disease  but by using medication consistently  people can find the treatment help they deserve  this also has the potential to reduce the burden for not only themselves  but their caregivers and loved ones as well    the panss is composed of   subscales  positive scale  negative scale  and general psychopathology scale  each subscale is rated with   to   points ranging from absent to extreme  each of the    items is accompanied by a specific definition as well as detailed anchoring criteria for all seven rating points  these seven points represent increasing levels of psychopathology  as follows     absent    minimal    mild    moderate    moderate severe    severe    extreme  the panss overall total score ranges from    to      with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity  the primary efficacy endpoint was measured by change from baseline to week   against the panss total score    these data reinforce the potential of tev      as a subcutaneous long acting injectable by using a proven molecule with an established long acting delivery system   said christoph correll  md  professor of psychiatry at the zucker school of medicine  hempstead  ny and solaris study co ordinating investigator   most patients with schizophrenia will experience one or more relapses throughout their treatment journeys  so i very much welcome the development of new and innovative long acting treatment options that may better fit into their lives     the positive news from the phase iii solaris trial continues to encourage ongoing innovation in treatment options for those living with schizophrenia  we are thrilled to be part of this journey with teva through a strong partnership that allows us to leverage our pioneering long acting technology for the benefit of patients   said christophe douat  ceo of medincell   additional efficacy and safety findings from the phase   solaris study are planned for presentation at a medical meeting later this year   the long term safety of tev      and incidence of pdss are also being evaluated in the solaris open label

i ve been on the stuff for a few years  if you re someone new to it  or looking at getting it  i ll share with you the words of advice my sleep specialist gave to me  sugar free lemonade    mio drops  generic is fine   lemonade hides it the best  orange is okay  can t taste it at all  and i m at    g  twice a night   the powdered stuff works okay  but that s a pita because you ve gotta have a pitcher in your bedroom to bathroom and that s just inconvenient    yes  it affects the meds  the acid in the lemonade does the exact same thing to the oxybate that your stomach acid would also instantly do  it converts it from the oxybate form to the active form  ghb  it doesn t alter efficacy  it doesn t alter absorption  it just hides the taste  the reason it specifically states to use water is because that is what was used in clinical trials  that s all they re allowed to say to take it with  if it had been trialed using jolt cola as a mixer  then that s what your script would say  they use water in clinical trials to get approval for meds to rule out that something else was causing the observed effects being claimed by the medication  it s perfectly safe to do   and i can actually honestly say  trust me  i m a scientist   im a former plant biologist  who also used to work in dairy qc  cannabis  pharmaceuticals  semiconductor r d  industrial water purification  industrial haz waste  and now battery r d  a multidisciplinary researcher      and do not  for any reason  use root beer  it doesn t conceal anything and simply tastes like you re drinking root beer flavored salt water  in fact  that s true with pretty much all soda    she suggested the sugar free lemonade to me the day i first got my script  it makes the stuff actually palatable  plus  all that citric acid will help prevent calcium oxalate kidney stones from forming  something the high sodium levels in oxybate help to encourage to form  it s a win win

recent studies have suggested that long covid may be caused by a prolonged  subclinical infection leading to the establishment of a viral reservoir  potentially in the gut    that can modulate host immune responses and contribute to persistent cognitive symptoms        surgery in such patients could result in unintentional spread of the sars cov   viral reservoir to distal tissues such as the lung  where infection can cause severe damage    autoantibody responses directed against central nervous system antigens  including myelin and g protein coupled receptors  also are detectable in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and strongly correlate with abnormal cognitive status in long covid patients    surgery in patients with already elevated autoantibody levels may induce further autoimmunity due to tissue damage leading to epitope spreading     finally  defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and lipid catabolism have been linked with cognitive and noncognitive symptoms of long covid       and surgery in long covid patients with mitochondrial dysfunction may prolong the recovery phase  further studies are needed to determine if the prevalence of these various biomarkers is reflective of underlying disease processes or of preexisting long covid both before and after surgery   mitigating the impact of long covid on surgery though cognitive symptoms caused by long covid may be difficult to diagnose  there are strategies to help surgeons identify biomarkers of import  for example  clinical diagnostic testing can be used to identify long covid patients who may have a persistent infection  in addition to testing for the presence of sars cov   in the nasopharynx  it may be important to test for viral rna or protein present in stool samples from long covid patients before elective surgery  as the gut may be a cryptic viral reservoir   one possible intervention for patients suspected of having a persistent infection may be to administer nirmatrelvir ritonavir  paxlovid  as preoperative prophylaxis to help clear infection  there is some evidence that nirmatrelvir ritonavir may help alleviate long covid symptoms as well    and it is currently being tested as a treatment for long covid in clinical trials     another option for surgeons when confronted with patients at risk for postoperative delirium who also may have long covid is to refer them to a long covid clinic for evaluation  not only can their baseline cognitive status be determined  but further testing if needed can be suggested during this evaluation  there are multiple long covid clinics that are associated with large academic medical centers as well as community hospitals located throughout the us    many offer televisits for patients who are not local  long covid clinics offer consultation across multiple specialties of internal medicine  and therefore  could be used to assess the status of long covid patients with both cognitive and noncognitive symptoms  these are just two examples of how surgeons might consider modifying their care plans for patients with long covid who also are at risk for postoperative delirium  much work remains to be done before the root causes of long covid related cognitive dysfunction can be determined and effective treatments developed   given that the number of adults with long covid who are experiencing prolonged though often subtle and nuanced cognitive changes  is growing and that surgical intervention can adversely affect long term cognition  it remains unknown how this syndrome will affect the health outcomes of surgical patients

often not on optimal medications or had best practice devices or other therapies  the health disparities for pacific islander patients was even worse  in one survey  they found many native hawaiian

clinical trial participation    one way to address health disparity is to make sure that all communities have access to clinical trial information and infrastructure  and  hawaii heron is supporting initiatives such as  expansion of culturally and linguistically tailored health education   heron s work  identifies   barriers   to clinical trails and suggests   strategies to increase engagement and enrollment   of native hawaiian and other pacific islander people in clinical trials     develop  culturally appropriate  clinical and health literature and engagement strategies  i e   develop  stories   since their is storytelling tradition  and have these being told by other patients in the community  culturally appropriate interaction also means spending time with people  not rushed  answering questions and being respectful    availability is an issue      have you ever been asked to be in a clinical trial     and we found with the white patients  they had all had some experience  or almost all of them had some experience of at least being asked  or knowing somebody that was in a trial  but the vast majority of native hawaiian and pacific islander patients said they were never asked to be in a tria l     trust is an issue    just offering participation in trial is not enough  there has to be a culture of  accepting  in the community that clinical trials do more good than harm  for that    work with people  embedded  in community  people trust their primary care physicians and health providers who are from the same community  creating mentorship and training programs  when asked    do you trust your doctor to do what s best for your health       of them said yes     expand  data availability   clinical data on native hawaiians and  in particular  pacific islanders is sparse  since these communities are often lumped with asians as  other   asian americans have the longest life expectancy and very different issues  less data on native hawaiians and pacific islanders means  invisibility  and perpetuation of disparities     postscript    heron researchers ended the podcast with   the main finding  which is both surprising and not surprising  is how interested and eager the patients that we saw  native hawaiian and pacific islander patients  were to enroll or engage in clinical trials       why medical writers should care    heron s work is

i know y all like shouty ai generated dd full of bad analogies  but let s try something different   prokidney  prok  is a pharma company that is developing a new cell therapy treatment for chronic kidney disease called react  about   m americans have kidney disease  and about   m live with kidney failure  so it s very common and there is a lot of money in treatment   just look at the   b market cap of dva  a dialysis company   prok has made it through phase    and is preparing to start phase   of clinical trials but their manufacturing is on pause right now due to an audit of its quality management  they have brought in some new executives and are working on expanding operations over the next few years and opening new facilities in nc with the support of greensboro and winston salem  they say they have enough capital to survive through the end of the       but plan on start manufacturing again  mid           bear case    the bear case is pretty straightforward  they are not able to start manufacturing again or they start manufacturing again but the phase   results disappoint  this is certainly a possibility and a big risk  there is not a lot of news that comes out about the company and it s hard to tell if they are on schedule  there is a real danger they could burn through their cash and go bk     bull case    the short term bull case is that they start manufacturing again in the next few months  this positive news could be a catalyst that brings buyers  a longer term bull case is that they not only fix their quality issues and start manufacturing again  but also have positive stage   results  this could     x in the next   years if things go right     price    about a month ago  the price shot up on no news  i think this got picked up by some short screener algos and some pharma tracking sites  however  i don t think this is any kind of squeeze play so i don t even want to speak to short interest  the play here is primarily that positive news comes out in the next few months   also  it s worth noting that the options for this ticker are not very liquid  there is at least an option chain so you can try to grab contracts  but don t bid ask spreads are huge and you won t move anything quickly     disclosure    i am long prok  i am holding shares             calls  and            calls  i plan on rolling those contracts forward until there is some news  i see this as a true bet with high risk and high upside        tldr  prok is a pharma company on a manufacturing pause and may either go under or see a big upside if they can start up production again 
i m not sure what to do or how to be a good friend without jeopardizing my own wellbeing    i have been friends with jane since middle school  we both have families with young children  she has a baby as well  for the past year and a half jane has had a mysterious illness  it has turned her life upside down    i haven t been able to see her because it s possibly contagious  but we d still occasionally talk on the phone or text  i d send food  i ve also had some poor health and was recently misdiagnosed  so  we would commiserate together    because she s so contagious  jane had to move out of her house and in with her parents away from her children  her parents eventually kicked her out because they re older and were starting to catch her disease  she s now living with her bil in his attic    she can barely go out  she s going stir crazy and is spiraling down into a dark place  the doctors can t seem to help her and some have even said she was crazy  she s been doing a lot of internet research and she found something that said researchers are doing clinical trials with a medication that is helping people with the disease like hers   but it s for animals    she has asked a lot of her friends if they can get her this medication  one said she would but changed her mind  another said she would  but then  can t remember  to send it    she called me today  crying  saying she couldn t live like this  she couldn t go another day without being with her children  her baby was already forgetting her  her milk dried up    she knows i play fast and loose with the rules  she begged me to get her the medication  she said she would kill herself if she didn t get it  it s the only thing giving her hope    i said i would get it for her and i did  but i don t think i can actually give it to her  i looked up some of the side effects  it s super rare  but it has been known to kill animals    what do i do  what if i give it to her and she dies  but if i don t give it to her and she kills herself  that s my fault too  she s my best friend  i don t want her to hate me forever  but i don t want to be responsible if something bad happens to her  if it gets traced back to me  is that manslaughter  should i call her husband  should i tell him she s suicidal  is that breaking her trust    what should i do

  barred from each other  why normative husbands remain married to incarcerated wives an exploratory study   page      you ve got to understand  what we re talking about here is great love  that s the whole story  the idea of leaving her never came up  it was never mentioned or discussed  our romantic life could never be dismantled just because one of us did something wrong  separation is totally irrelevant    after exposing her crime   i never felt as if i don t love her or want her less  it s all a matter of pure commitment built on pure love and this is something you do not abandon   a        i decided to stay with her for two reasons  great love and great commitment  i swear that   after her incarceration   it never crossed my mind to leave her  i m with her until the end  our love is priceless  i don t care for other women  i m just waiting for her  i always knew from the second i met her that we will be together until death  i will not desert her regardless of the situation  she is the best thing that ever happened to me   d        i told myself  you re not going to leave her no matter what happens  we ve been together since we re     we love each other a lot and we re committed to each other  let it be clear i decided to stay with her just because of us  and not because of the kids and the house  i love her very much  she is the love of my life and my best friend and i m staying with her no matter what happens   s   a    year old jewish husband  married to an inmate sentenced to a period of    months in prison  continues in the same vein   interestingly  in addition to the decisive description of all research participants of their marriage in terms of love and devotion  six participants related to these relations and their spouses in adorable and admirable ways  these participants perceive their women partners as being unique and exceptional  each a veritable femme fatale  and describe the relations with them in various flattering and admirable ways   she is everything to me  when i look to the right i see her  when i look to the left i see  her  i see her and no one else but her  i admire her  she is pure gold  there is no one like her  in the world and that s why our love is so strong   y   a    year old jewish husband  married  to a first timer sentenced to   years   and this sentiment is echoed in two other statements   i admire my wife  she is bigger than life itself  i can only thank god that she s mine that i have her   s        she is a very special woman and a friend  she is special  not like any other woman   a        while these quotations illustrate the high appreciation and admiration of the women spouses  the next ones portray the specific personal characteristics that make the women so admirable   she is the most clever  intelligent  and lovely woman in the world  she is energetic  active  and dominant  an amazing woman   t       she is a good soul  she is warm and emphatic    mentally   stronger than any man i know  very reliable  she has so many virtues  understandable  intelligent  supportive  funny  and very ethical   d        she is   mentally   a very strong woman  she is remarkable       outstanding  she knows everything regardless of the fact that she s in prison   z        she is a good human being  she takes care of everyone       pays attention to everyone       she loves to help people   a       all the participants love and admire their partners and perceive them as an attached and inherent part of their past  present  and future married lives  these statements clearly demonstrate that love is perceived as an essential component for the preservation of good marital relations in general and in times of crisis  moreover  regardless of female spouses  criminal conduct and imprisonment  most partners describe them as ideal and wonderful women  using words of admiration  as such  continuation of the marriage to them may be perceived as an obvious and rational act     perception of wife s criminal conduct    numerous studies have argued that most female inmates are abandoned by their male counterparts  be it because of the forced disengagement and or the shame in their  betrayal  of the law  their families  and their  traditional gender roles   mcgowan   blumenthal        stanton         evidently  such desertion is solely dependent on men s discretion  irrespective of the female inmates  desires  dodge   pogrebin        pelka slugocka   slugocki          somewhat in contrast to these studies  our findings indicate that although all participants acknowledge that their spouses committed various criminal offenses and morally reject it  they do not perceive them and their criminal conduct as shameful and disgraceful  specifically  the participants  deliberately or unintentionally  describe their spouses  criminal behaviors in a forgiving manner  explaining it as a  sad tale   i e   an outcome of harsh and complicated life story  scott   lyman         by doing so  they invalidate the female inmates  moral and criminal responsibilities  detach their criminal conduct from their character  and defend their dignity and importance   my wife did not do all these things  she meant to do no bad  i know that she doesn t act out of evilness       she is a good person       a victim of herself  she didn t really want to kill me       it is not her fault       her friends are bad       they pushed her to act this way  i can t believe and i don t believe that she did what she did independently   a        they   the police   found some financial inconsistencies in the bank and instead of exposing the truth and framing her brother  she took responsibility  i knew she did everything in order to save her brother  she is a good soul and her family members abused her  all she did was done in order to protect her family and not because she s bad  she is a good soul       a queen who made a mistake in order to save her brother   s        she did not take it   the money   for herself       she gave it to her family  she has a big family and someone had to take care of them  looking back  i think she had no choice   i        six participants use neutralization techniques  sykes   matza        to support their contention of their partners  morality  the men resort to  denial of injury  and  denial of responsibility   in their simplest form  the former technique suggests that this was a no victim crime and the latter proposes that the criminal actions were caused by forces beyond the perpetrator s control  enticott          after all  what did she do  what crime had she committed  it s not that she enjoyed the money  it s not that she is walking around wearing lots of jewelry  she s a modest individual and all in all she did not take big sums of money  maybe they   justice system   can define her as an offender  but for me she is p   my beloved wife  and that s that   c        n fact  what did she do  she got involved with the gray market  something that could happen to anyone  and they forced her to do what she did  it could happen to me  to you  to anyone  she made a mistake but she is only human  but it s not a crime and she s not a criminal   z        no  my wife is not a criminal  she didn t break the law  in my opinion  all she did was make a single mistake  the fact that she s in prison does not make her a criminal   i          difficulties in marital relationships with incarcerated wife    numerous studies have repeatedly argued that three factors underlie most crises in marital relationships  diminished  or extinguished  love  reduced  or lack of  intimacy  and weakened  or nonexistent  commitment  mace        sabatelli   cecil pigo        sharlin        sokolski   hendrick        surra et al          our findings deviate somewhat and indicate that regardless of lengths of imprisonment and or marriage  the major difficulty experienced by most  n      participants relates to lack of physical intimacy  all other inconveniences and difficulties characterizing marital relationships in crisis  huston  caughlin  houts  smith    george        appear to be irrelevant to the interviewees   during the last six months   time of spouse s incarceration   everything has obviously changed  because of her physical absence  we meet once a month   conjugal visits   and it is not enough  i miss the physical intimacy  the physical togetherness  i miss it  it is difficult  i currently and practically live with no romantic relationships  i miss her body and her smell    i        i miss her smell  she has amazing smells  nothing i experienced with other women  i miss having sex with her  i miss being hugged by her  feeling her head on my shoulder   d          you can t believe   how much i miss her  i miss her hugs  i miss the physical contact with her  i miss going to sleep with her   t        an additional difficulty  raised by six       participants  relates to lack of support by family members  friends  and acquaintances  in some cases  participants report that people totally ignored or terminated relationships after the incarceration  the participants view this kind of behavior as an outcome of shame and or disappointment   it wasn t easy with my family   because   they wanted me to divorce her  they didn t understand how she could do that and didn t accept her  they were really furious  they decided to break off relations with her  my reaction  by the way  was to completely break off my relations with my family   z        some family members and all my neighbors told me that i should be ashamed of my wife  in school  my children suffered daily harassments from other children  from the teachers  and even from the headmaster  all of them wanted us to forget her as if she were dead  they think she should be  dead        deleted   s        two very close friends of ours were informed   by us   about the trial and the offense  it was very embarrassing  yet  their reaction was even more embarrassing and made us want to bury ourselves deep in the ground  in the most difficult moment of our life  they deserted us  they had a very dramatic discussion with my wife on the phone with lots of shouting and yelling and then  decided to stop talking to us  these people are not human beings  you cannot call them friends   y        none of her friends called or asked us how we feel  none of our friends came to visit her in prison  is this friendship  this is disgusting  it s very difficult to live with the notion that suddenly  when you are in trouble  everyone disappears  suddenly  no one wishes to be your friend   a          preconditions for the continuation of marital relationships between normative men and incarcerated wives    all research participants have pointed out two central factors that could have had a negative effect on the marriage  perhaps even leading to their termination of this relationship   a  length of prison sentence and  b  length of marriage prior to the imprisonment   length of prison sentence  most  n      participants assert that because their spouses were sentenced to relatively short terms of imprisonment  they did not consider leaving them  however  they also state that if the sentence had been longer  they may have considered terminating the marriage and finding a new relationship   i don t know what would have happened to our romantic relationships if she d been imprisoned for  let s say     years  i believe i would have separated from her  it s like disappearing from someone s life for a very long time  time is definitely a significant factor    i        on the day of the verdict  when the judge said    years   i felt as if my hands were freezing  if it were    or    years  then i d probably acted differently  i doubt if i would have stayed with her       with all due respect to love   z        these findings strengthen previous findings  holt   miller        walker        revealing a decline in visiting patterns among wives of long term prisoners compared with wives of short termers  as well as deterioration of marriages over long periods of incarceration   i had a

findings  holt   miller        walker        revealing a decline in visiting patterns among wives of long term prisoners compared with wives of short termers  as well as deterioration of marriages over long periods of incarceration     length of marriage prior to incarceration      the men s decision to remain married was determined  to a significant degree  to the duration of the relationship prior to the woman s incarceration  our findings show that all participants perceive the total length of the relationship prior to spouses  incarceration to be positively correlated to their decision to remain married   if we d been married for a year and then she d begun committing crimes  i would have separated from her  but now  after so many years of marriage  there is no way i would leave her  the length of our romantic relationships is a critical factor  that s why i couldn t see any option of leaving her   i        please don t forget that i didn t meet her yesterday  we ve been together for almost    years  we went through many things together  it s a lot of time and obviously  i won t leave her   d         ways of preserving the marital relationships with incarcerated wives    all participants  n      report that to deal with their pain of separation and maintain marital relationships  they use two tactics frequent phone calls and making all visits  that the prison allows   the men receive four or five phone calls a day from their imprisoned partners  both partners await these phone calls and cherish them  as the frequent and continuous delivery and receipt of information create a semblance of the exchange of information that occurs when living under the same roof  symbolically  the ongoing communication  and hearing the partner s voice  signifies a continuation of everyday   dyadic and nondyadic   normal life   we constantly maintain telephone contact  i m like a child  again and again waiting for her phone calls  it doesn t matter whether i am with friends  at work  or at a restaurant  i wait for her to call me all the time  she calls me three times a day  in the morning  noon  and in the evening hours   t        we talk on the phone all day and every day  we actually do everything through the phone  we talk about her feelings  what happened to her in prison during the day  what happened to me at work  and how we miss each other  that s basically it   d        i love it when she calls me  i look forward to her phone calls  that s how i really know what is going on with her in prison   s        the second tactic is routinely coming for the bi weekly    min visits to which all prisoners are entitled  whether or not they are also allowed home furloughs  ips         the visits take place on saturdays and sundays  and all families gather in a relatively small  closed  and sealed space  there are open visits in which the inmate can be in physical touch with the visitors and closed visits  conducted through an armored glass division  all participants welcome the visits  perceive them as the best temporary way of realizing their marriage  and look forward to them   i visit her every two weeks  up to now  i haven t missed a single visit  we were limited to    minute in person visits every two weeks during her first year  after that they let us have a    hour conjugal visit each month  now she can come home   on furlough   for    hours every month  that time of being together in the home refreshes our love  in addition  we talk on the phone four times a day  i wait for these calls because i love talking to her  we talk about her day  about my day  about things that happened to both of us at work  about intimate thoughts   a        i visit her every two weeks  sometimes with her parents and sometimes alone  we sit together  talk  laugh  and try to make use of our   joint   time   y        i come to visit her every two weeks  i never missed a single visit  occasionally  i bring our son with me  we wake up at   in the morning and drive   hours just to see her for    minutes  and then we have to drive   hours back  but i wouldn t have missed it for the world   c          discussion    incarceration affects all aspects of family life  including the health and well being of inmates  spouses and children  and the maintenance of family attachments  it can also lead to marital dissolution  comfort        goffman        lopoo   western        western   wildeman         most studies concerning the impact of imprisonment on inmates  marriages have focused on the effects of men s incarceration  chui        wildeman  schnittker    turney         whereas only scarce attention directed at the effects of women s incarceration on their families  this appears to be quiet odd   and disturbing   in light of research findings showing that most incarcerations of men rarely result in marital breakup  dodge   pogrebin        travis et al          whereas most women sentenced to prison are abandoned by their partners and their pre incarceration romantic relations are terminated  hairston   addams        sergin   flora          the current study provides important information about the characteristics  motivation  and justifications of men to preserve marital relationships with their imprisoned spouses  out of     prisoners incarcerated in the single israeli female incarceration facility  neve tirza prison  only nine  of whom eight took part in the study  maintain stable marital relationships longer than   years  all these inmates except one  who was sentenced to     months  had no criminal records prior to current imprisonment  and were only sentenced to a relatively short time of incarceration  m        months   interestingly  all spouses  but one  have no prior criminal record and therefore can be considered normative  i e   law abiding    the interviews yielded five overarching themes   a  perceptions of marital relations with incarcerated spouse   b  perceptions of wife s criminal conduct   c  difficulties in marital relationships with incarcerated spouse   d  preconditions for the continuation of marital relationships between normative men and incarcerated wives   e  and ways of preserving the marital relationships with incarcerated partners  the discovery that the wife had committed a crime  the following arrest  initial stages of incarceration  and mainly the concealment of the crime from family and community members are experienced as stressful crises  yet  participants describe incarceration as a challenge that brought the couple even closer  enhancing mutual responsibility and commitment   this study elucidates the shock and devastation that comes with the discovery that one s wife had committed a crime  and then with the following arrest and the initial stages of incarceration  the psychosocial effects of finding out about the crime linger well beyond the time of initial shock  thus  although four       of the participants were interviewed   years or more after they had first learned of their wives  criminal actions  they still referred to the great difficulty of discovery and its long lasting negative impact  specifically  all participants testified that the incarceration of their female partners raised frustrations  tension  and lack of trust that led them to reconsider their motivation to preserve their marriages  they clearly described the disruption the revelation caused and the resulting strain on their marital relationship   although the romantic relationship was undoubtedly stressed by the discovery of the crime  the arrest  and the incarceration  all participants seemed to have had the resources to meet this challenge or found appropriate support to do so  our findings indicate that the incarceration led the husbands to recognize their obligation to their partners and to their relationship  similarly  clinical experience and several empirical studies suggest that some couples facing hospitalization  critical illness  or serious injuries perceive their marital relationship to be improved since the medical episode  e  g   dorval et al          the trauma often creates a powerful

in a recent  announcement  https   www globenewswire com news release                      en nuvectis pharma inc reports first quarter      financial results and business highlights html    text the   company s   net   loss   was   dcash   stock  dbased   compensation    nuvectis pharma  a trailblazer in precision medicine for oncology  unveiled its financial results for the first quarter of       the company  known for its innovative approach to developing targeted therapies for serious oncological conditions  has not only shown promising clinical progress but also exemplified fiscal responsibility and strategic financial management     strong financial footing  nuvectis pharma began the year on solid ground  with cash and cash equivalents totaling       million as of march           up from       million at the end of       this increase is attributed to the prudent use of its at the market facility  which has been carefully balanced with its operational expenditures  despite a slight increase in net loss from      million in q       to      million in q        the company maintains a robust financial posture    the company continued to invest in research and development  r d   which is crucial for the advancement of its clinical programs  seeing a modest rise to      million from      million in the same period last year  the fact that r d expenses represent a significant part of  the company s expenses is positive indicator for such a company  this reflects nuvectis pharma s ongoing commitment to advancing its pipeline  particularly its two flagship drugs  nxp    and nxp        pioneering precision medicine  at the core of nuvectis pharma s mission is the development of precision medicines that target specific patient populations within the oncology sphere  this approach is not only more efficient but is increasingly seen as more effective  with therapies designed to improve outcomes for patients based on their unique genetic profiles  precision medicine in oncology leverages detailed understanding of a patient s genetic makeup to develop treatments that are both more effective and often have fewer side effects compared to traditional therapies   the potential of precision medicine in oncology is vividly illustrated by the recent success of immunogen  a company that developed elahere  a targeted therapy for platinum resistant ovarian cancer  elahere specifically targets cancer cells with minimal impact on healthy tissue  representing a significant advancement in treatment options for patients who have limited alternatives  the fda s approval of elahere underscores its efficacy and safety  culminating in its acquisition by abbvie for approximately       billion  this acquisition highlights the substantial value that can be created through the development of effective treatments for cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat     clinical milestones and management expertise  nuvectis pharma is making significant advances in developing treatments for some of the hardest to treat cancers  among their promising drugs  nxp    has shown encouraging preliminary results in a study targeting a type of ovarian cancer resistant to conventional therapies  recognizing the potential of this innovative treatment  the u s  food and drug administration  fda  has granted it fast track designation to expedite its development and review process  moreover  nxp    has also received orphan drug designation for its use in cholangiocarcinoma  a rare and difficult to treat cancer  this designation is particularly important as it not only facilitates tax benefits and provides marketing exclusivity for seven years post approval  but also may allow the drug to be given to patients under conditional marketing authorization or even compassionate use programs  these programs are crucial as they can enable patients to access new therapies prior to full approval in situations where no satisfactory alternatives exist   nxp     another key drug candidate from nuvectis  targets the src yes  kinase pathway  which is integral in driving growth in several types of cancers  including lung cancer  recent presentations at the      aacr conference showcased nxp    s potential to re sensitize resistant non small cell lung cancer cells to existing treatments  offering a new hope in combating this challenging disease   the experienced leadership team at nuvectis  led by chairman and ceo ron bentsur  brings a wealth of knowledge in navigating the complex regulatory and development landscape  their proven track record in drug development and commercialization enhances nuvectis  ability to successfully bring these vital new treatments to market     looking ahead       is could to be a transformational year for nuvectis pharma  the company is likely several clinical data updates ein the second half of the year  moreover  given its strong financial position and experienced management  the company seems well positioned to advance its pipeline toward commercialization  its careful financial management ensures that it has the necessary runway to reach these milestones without the immediate need for additional capital    as nuvectis pharma continues to advance its targeted therapies through clinical trials  its approach not only underscores the power of precision medicine in oncology but also exemplifies fiscal prudence and strategic agility in the biotech industry  for patients with limited treatment options and investors looking for thoughtful growth  nuvectis stands out as a beacon of hope and a compelling investment opportunity  with a management team that blends extensive experience with a clear strategic vision  nuvectis is adeptly navigating the complex landscape of drug development  this positions the company not only to meet current challenges but also to create substantial impact in the lives of patients worldwide  setting the stage for future

  trial day      katherine   trent jackson was in court     cardiologist dr  daniel wohlgelernter testimony      jackson direct    cardiologist dr  daniel wohlgelernter testifying as an expert witness for katherine jackson  he is a yale medical school graduate and has practiced in southern california since       dr  daniel wohlgelernter  has taught at yale and ucla  he practices in santa monica  california  during the morning session  the dr  testified about elements of the contract  including descriptions of med equipment included in the contract  murray s agreement to close down his las vegas clinic to work full time for jackson created a conflict  he said  the agreement said murray could lose his job if the tour was delayed or canceled      it meant that dr  murray was entirely dependent on the continuation of the tour for his income   he said  wohlgelernter also said he was troubled by a section of murray s contract that said the doctor was to     perform the services reasonably requested by the producer   which was aeg   that meant murray was  responsible and accountable to a third party  namely aeg live   wohlgelernter said   not his patient  leading to a conflict of interest   dr  wohlgelernter testified that propofol needs to be administered by an anesthesiologist who is properly trained  wohlgelernter testified that propofol should be given only in a hospital setting and administered by an anesthesiologist because there is a risk the patient can stop breathing    cardiologists  like murray  are not competent to administer propofol   he said   wohlgelernter said murray  was not fit and competent in so far as he administered medications he was not trained and credentialed to administer and administered them in a whole unsatisfactory environment    dr  wohlgelernter said murray was not the right doctor   not appropriately trained for what mj had   substance abuse  addiction  and a sleep disorder    michael jackson had a history of substance abuse  addiction to medications and sleep disturbance   he said   not heart or cardiovascular problems   wohlgelernter said murray did not have the appropriate training to serve as jackson s physician for the this is it tour  instead of a cardiologist like murray  the expert witness said that jackson needed a doctor who was trained in addiction medicine  substance abuse and sleep disorders  since jackson had no evidence of heart disease  murray was not an appropriate choice to treat him  the witness said   attorneys for both sides told the panel last week that jackson suffered from longstanding prescription drug addiction issues  which wohlgelernter said murray had no formal training on how to treat  the former cardiologist was also unqualified to administer propofol  the powerful anesthetic that killed him    for michael jackson  given that he had no history of heart disease    a cardiologist s experience and skills and credentials would not be appropriate  it s a mismatch  it s not what he needs   he said  adding   my opinion is that dr  murray was not an appropriate choice to serve as michael jackson s physician on the this is it tour  it s not the right doctor for this patient    wohlgelernter said the fact that dr  conrad murray  a cardiologist  shut his practice to care only for jackson  who had no history of heart problems     that to me is a red flag   wohlgelernter said    he asked why murray would      leave what he was doing for a patient who doesn t need his services    the physician said he and murray had received much of the same types of training over the courses of their careers  but that only anesthesiologists should administer propofol and that treating addiction or insomnia requires specialized training    jackson lawyer   do you believe conrad murray was competent and fit for aeg to hire           dr  wohlgelernter   no   doctor testified he thought dr  murray not up to the standard of care because of his only admission that mj had stopped breathing  dr  wohlgelernter said dr  murray should have opened an airway but instead chose chest compressions   he testified that murray gave mj incorrect treatment when he noticed michael had stopped breathing as a result of propofol murray had administered   wohlgelernter told the jurors that murray improperly focused on jackson s heart when michael stopped breathing after receiving propofol and other drugs on the morning of          dr  wohlgelernter said that murray used chest compressions when he saw that jackson was in distress  rather than focusing on getting his breathing restarted     my opinion is that conrad murray repeatedly failed  to meet  the standard of care in his treatment of michael jackson   he said   wohlgelernter said murray made repeated mistakes  including using propofol outside of a hospital  leaving jackson unattended  focusing on his heart rather than breathing when he found him apparently lifeless  and delaying calling         my opinion is that these departures from the standard of care    were a substantial factor in the death of michael jackson   said the senior cardiologist    aeg cross    aeg attorney cahan tried to get the dr  to change his opinion that murray was unqualified to treat addiction  sleep issues  the dr stuck to his opinion that murray was unqualified to treat jackson  he did say murray was qualified as an internal medicine doctor  under cross examination by cahan  wohlgelernter testified that murray s training and credentials were reputable and he appeared to be a competent internal medicine physician  the dr  was also asked about dr  murray s training and education  he said murray studied  trained at respectable institutions   wohlgelernter  however  said jackson s request for murray to be his doctor and murray s desire to leave other patients behind to work with the singer should have caused aeg some concern  wohlgelernter said the company should have asked why the two men wanted to work with each other  the witness also said that murray s request for a cpr machine  written into his contract  a device used when patients undergo heart surgery  should have raised questions     what is this doctor planning to do    wohlgelernter asked   what are his treatment plans in taking care of michael jackson    another warning  he said  was jackson s request for murray  considering the singer s background with drug use      it s a red flag to the extent that michael jackson has a history of substance abuse and addiction that he specifically is requesting a given doctor who has no training in any of those areas  what is the nature of this relationship  why do these two want each other    cahan asked the dr to testify about murray s proposed contract w  aeg  doctor said he wasn t qualified to testify about its elements  contract shows that dr  murray was hired to be mj s general practitioner  the contract shown was only signed by dr  murray not by aeg or mj  dr  wohlgelernter did no know if dr  murray was ever paid   dr  said he has never administered propofol and he s never written a patient a prescription for propofol   cahan asked about whether he d heard of different classes of doctors and internists administering propofol  the dr said no each time  he also said he d never heard of an anesthesiologist administering propofol in a residence   cahan asked similar questions about cpr  he said it was reasonable to expect a cardiologist  internist  etc  to give proper cpr   cahan did ask the doctor if the company could have asked murray about jackson s medical conditions  dr  wohlgelernter said they couldn t have because of hippa  the medical privacy law   jackson s medical info could have been disclosed with a waiver  he said  the doctor concluded his testimony by saying he wasn t aware of any investigation aeg did into murray s background   court transcript  https   www teammichaeljackson com dr daniel wohgelernter cardiologist

the university of missouri and columbia university in new york have partnered up for a  moonshot  project called nova joint  the development of a fully biological knee replacement grown in a lab  which might be ready for patients in the next five years   the partnership is one of five teams working on projects from the advanced research projects agency for health  the team will receive     million in funding if it continues to meet the project s milestones   the science and engineering behind the nova joint will come primarily out of columbia university  with mu advising  mu will then be responsible for animal trials in year two and clinical trials in subsequent years   the knee replacement would involve growing cartilage and bone from a patient s own cells or donor cells  said

associate professor of biomedical engineering in orthopedic surgery at columbia university   two versions of the replacement will be created with the hopes they will be more reliable than the traditional knee replacement  one version of the joint will be grown with donated cells and is expected to be created within    hours of knowing who the patient is  this is considered the more  off the shelf  concept  but still poses a large challenge for researchers   the other option involves growing replacement tissue within    days using the patient s own cells  these processes do not grow brand new knees  but rather stem cells and tissues that are then delivered into the joint along with biodegradable material that will support the joint until it is reabsorbed by the body  this material will degrade as the new cells begin to grow and eventually fully support the joint    we would love to try and do something perfectly  and i think the only way really is to try and restore

cannabinoids    a new review of the science around the components of marijuana says the  complex interaction between phytocannabinoids and biological systems offers hope for novel treatment approaches   laying the groundwork for a new era of innovation in cannabis based medicines   among other takeaways  the report  published earlier this month in the international journal of molecular sciences  underscores the potential of whole plant cannabis medicine incorporating the variety of cannabinoids  terpenes and other compounds produced by the cannabis plant rather than simply thc or cbd on their own    the plant  cannabis  exhibits an effect called the  entourage effect   in which the combined actions of terpenes and phytocannabinoids results in effects that exceed the sum of their separate contributions   the study says   this synergy emphasizes how important it is to consider the entire plant when utilizing cannabinoids medicinally as opposed to just concentrating on individual cannabinoids    much of the    page report from pharmacy researchers at ovidus university of constanta and the university of medicine  pharmacy science and technology of t rgu mures  both of which are in romania comprises an overview of cannabinoids  including thc and cbd as well as cannabigerol  cbg   cannabichromene  cbc   cannabinol  cbn  and tetrahydrocannabivarin  thc v  as well as how those compounds appear to interact with the human body   while the vast majority of research has studied thc and cbd  the new review notes that the  exploration of novel phytocannabinoids is rapidly evolving  offering exciting prospects for future therapeutic applications     beyond well established compounds like thc and cbd  the quest for novel cannabinoids widens the scope of potential treatments   it says   each cannabinoid  with its unique chemical structure  interacts differently with the   endocannabinoid system    suggesting tailored therapeutic effects for specific conditions  this exploration seeks to harness similar benefits while circumventing associated drawbacks    each of the chemical components has specific effects  which the study briefly describes  the broad review  which cites nearly     other sources  acknowledges that some effects are bolstered by robust scientific evidence  while others are still being explored   thc  for example  has demonstrated analgesic effects  authors wrote   it also possesses antiemetic effects  which make it useful for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting    cbd  meanwhile  has demonstrated anti inflammatory properties and  is said to have analgesic properties and may be effective in pain management   some research also shows the cannabinoid may have neuroprotective qualities   while cbd formulations like the prescription drug epidiolex can treat rare forms of epilepsy  mixes of cbd and thc may help address spasticity related to multiple sclerosis  the paper says   both thc and cbd also have antioxidant effects  it adds  and both appear to be promising tools for a variety of ailments  from pain to neurological disorders and psychiatric conditions   further  cbd may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and ptsd  while both thc and cbd may exhibit antidepressant effects   while some findings suggest that cannabinoids may have mood stabilizing effects and enhance serotonin signaling  the evidence is inconclusive  and further research is needed   the study says   cbd may also help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms of alcohol and opioid use disorders  although authors said  the evidence is preliminary  and more research is needed to establish its efficacy and safety    both thc and cbd have also been investigated as possible sleep aids  though results are still preliminary and so far are mixed  with some patients experiencing improved sleep quality while others experience sleep disruptions   as for treating cancer  the report says that studies have indicated that  cannabinoids can exert antitumor effects directly by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis  or indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis  invasion  and metastasis     in vivo and in vitro research has demonstrated the efficacy of cannabinoids in modulating tumor growth  although the antitumor effects can vary depending on the type of cancer and the concentration of the drug   it continues   for cancer patients  it is crucial to comprehend how cannabinoids control immune system interactions and other biological processes related to carcinogenesis  such as cell cycle progression  proliferation  and cell death  additional research is necessary for this area    as for minor cannabinoids  compounds such as cbg and cbn appear to have antibacterial effects  researchers found  cbn itself also appears to be a mild sedative  which could be relevant for treating sleep disorders   thc v  meanwhile  may act as an appetite suppressant and a  potential treatment for diabetes    cannabinoids may also be helpful in treating trauma wounds  authors noted  potentially reducing perceived pain  inflammation and secondary tissue damage    at the site of injury  cannabinoids may decrease the release of tissue activators and sensitizers  modulating nerve cells to control tissue destruction and immune cells to prevent the release of proinflammatory substances   they wrote   this modulation helps minimize pain and temper post injury responses associated with inflammatory injury    the review also assesses the  challenges and controversies  surrounding research and use of therapeutic cannabinoids  including legal and regulatory obstacles that still vary widely across the globe  a lack of robust standardization of cannabinoid products and the potential for abuse and dependence   thc  researchers acknowledge  is not only the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis but also the most common cannabinoid associated with problem use   while the overall risk of addiction to thc is lower compared to substances like opioids  amphetamines  or alcohol   authors wrote   it is still a concern  particularly for individuals who use cannabis frequently or in high doses    on the other hand  cbd  is not associated with the same potential for abuse or dependence  and  may even have potential therapeutic effects in reducing addiction to other substances  such as opioids  alcohol  or nicotine    social and legal obstacles  the study noted  still make research onerous    despite its potential  legal restrictions and societal stigma surrounding cannabis hinder investment in research and development   authors of the study wrote   complex regulatory frameworks further complicate exploration efforts  rigorous preclinical and clinical trials are imperative to establish safety and efficacy before therapeutic implementation    as cannabinoids and the body s own endocannabinoid system continue to be better understood  the researchers expect even more  potential in managing various pathological diseases     phytocannabinoids offer diverse therapeutic applications  ranging from pain management to neurological disorders and inflammatory diseases  their antimicrobial and anti inflammatory properties make them valuable candidates for combating antibiotic resistance and modulating inflammatory pathways   the  study  https   www mdpi com                      concludes   by leveraging the synergistic effects of combination therapies and targeting multiple disease pathways  phytocannabinoids hold immense potential to revolutionize the future of pharmacotherapy and improve human health outcomes    the new research is part of a growing field of investigation into the entourage effect in cannabis as well as in entheogenic plants and fungi  while western medicine typically seeks to identify and isolate a single active ingredient  the findings underscore the potentially powerful interactions of various chemical components produced by the plant   earlier this year  for example  a study looked at the   collaborative interactions  between cannabinoids  terpenes  flavonoids and other molecules in the plant  https   www marijuanamoment net new study shows how marijuana compounds like cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids interact for medical benefits    concluding that a better understanding of the relationships of various chemical components  is crucial for unraveling cannabis s complete therapeutic potential    other recent research funded by the national institute on drug abuse  nida  found that a citrusy smelling terpene in marijuana  d limonene   could help ease anxiety and paranoia associated with thc  https   www marijuanamoment net a citrusy smelling terpene in marijuana can reduce anxiety and paranoia caused by thc federally funded study finds    researchers similarly said the finding could help unlock the maximum therapeutic benefit of thc   a separate study last year found that cannabis products  with a more diverse array of natural cannabinoids produced stronger psychoactive experiences  https   www marijuanamoment net marijuana entourage effect with multiple cannabinoids produces a stronger and longer lasting high than pure thc study finds   in adults  which also lasted longer than the high generated by pure thc   and a      study found that patients suffering from epilepsy experience better health outcomes with fewer adverse side effects  when they use plant based cbd extracts compared to  purified  cbd products  https   www marijuanamoment net whole plant marijuana entourage effect helps patients more than purified cbd study finds     scientist last year also discovered   previously unidentified cannabis compounds  called flavorants  https   www marijuanamoment net researchers identify previously undiscovered cannabis compounds that give marijuana strains their unique aromas   that they believe are responsible for the unique aromas of different varieties of marijuana  previously  many had thought terpenes alone were responsible for various smells produced by the plant   similar phenomena are also beginning to be recorded around psychedelic plants and fungi  in march  for example  researchers published findings showing that  use of full spectrum psychedelic mushroom extract had a more powerful effect than chemically synthesized psilocybin alone  https   www marijuanamoment net study finds natural psychedelic mushrooms produce enhanced effects compared to synthesized psilocybin suggesting entourage effect    they said the findings imply that mushrooms  like cannabis  demonstrate an entourage effect    https   www marijuanamoment net interaction of marijuana terpenes and cannabinoids offers hope for novel treatments study says   https   www marijuanamoment net

   abstract     objectives    common age related health conditions can lead to poor mental health outcomes and deteriorate cognition  additionally  commonly prescribed medications for various mental physical health conditions may cause adverse reactions  especially among older adults  psychedelic therapy has shown positive impacts on cognition and has been successful in treating various mental health problems without long lasting adversities  the current study examines the association between psychedelic drug usage and cognitive functions in middle aged and older adults           methods    data were from wave               of the midlife in the united states  midus  study  we used multiple linear regression models examining associations between psychedelic usage and cognitive functions  controlling for covariates of sociodemographic and health factors           results    we included       individuals   m age             after controlling for covariates  the finding revealed that psychedelic usage was independently associated with more favorable changes in executive function             se            p          and less depressive symptoms              se            p           the same effect was not found for episodic memory             se            p                    discussion    addressing the mental health implications of physical health conditions in older adults are vital for preventing neurocognitive deterioration  prolonging independence  and improving the quality of life  more longitudinal research is essential utilizing psychedelics as an alternative therapy examining late life cognitive benefits      limitations   multiple limitations should be considered in interpreting the current result  first  psychedelic therapy requires longer time than other therapies  up to    hr per session   a properly prepared environment for the therapy session  and monitoring throughout the session   psiuk et al         https   journals sagepub com doi                           bibr                        because of its cross sectional nature  our study did not consider longer follow up     another issue with psychedelic therapy is that the hallucinations caused by psychedelic compounds may be too overwhelming for some patients      psiuk et al         https   journals sagepub com doi                           bibr                        although from the nature of the midus questionnaire it seems that    much of the use was as off label recreational purposes  with little understanding of dosage or safety  side effects and high dosages of certain psychedelics may outweigh the benefits     the most common side effects of psychedelic therapy are short term anxiety  psychological discomfort  headache  nausea  and vomiting   psiuk et al         https   journals sagepub com doi                           bibr                           micro dosing  small  reoccurring doses that do not alter perception  psilocybin or lsd may be a useful option for those who want to prevent the hallucinogenic effects     however  from the existing midus data  it is impossible to find out the exact form  frequency  and dosing of psychedelics used by the participants  inducing generalizability concerns  additionally  given the broad age range of participants  from middle aged to older adults  a potential generalizability bias in the results may arise from variations in baseline cognitive functions  finally  even after growing scientific interest in psychedelic medicines in recent years  their usage is limited even by physicians  probably due to hesitancy from its scientific evidence of risks and limited latest knowledge about psychedelics  for example  only a little over    of participants used psychedelics  including both classical and atypical psychedelics   as a key limitation of our analysis  posing some concern about our result  however  many participants were hesitant  around      refused to answer the question  to respond about psychedelic usage  reducing the chance of achieving stronger findings     conclusion   in conclusion  population aging is causing a significant increase in mental and physical health problems that negatively impact the quality of life of older adults  many current treatment options have proved to be ineffective and lead to even worse health outcomes  alternative therapies for age related diseases are necessary because there are ramifications of consuming various prescription medications  polypharmacy is common in older adults  and many current drug treatments for age related illnesses cause adverse side effects and interact poorly with each other  adverse drug reactions contribute to disability and the increasing need for care in older adults  for example  long term use of immunosuppressants can lead to health ramifications like diabetes  infections  hypertension  and osteoporosis   lallana   fadul        https   journals sagepub com doi                           bibr

cognitive impairment and  ultimately  dementia  although research on long term psychedelic usage is limited  recent evidences suggest benefits of serotonergic psychedelics in depression   husain et al

i ve been taking pregabalin at     mg  x daily for over   years  i recently moved to a new state and during my initial evaluation at the new pain management clinic  they did the typical urine drug screen  but  it was sent out to a lab for confirmatory testing    my new pcp here is managing my pregabalin  but i was interested in doing a spinal cord stimulator trial  so  i had my appointment and got a feeling for the clinic and see if it was a good fit  ultimately  i decided to go back to mayo as i just feel more comfortable there with any further procedure  still  i contacted the pain clinic and let them know what i decided and completed a release to get my visit note  i m disability for almost    years and learned to keep literally any medical note for any reason     today i got my record along with results from the urine drug screen  it was an extensive screen   i mean every substance  i noticed that the pregabalin was negative and so was every substance that was checked  however  the list didn t include baclofen  which i m also on and have been taking   mg  x daily for   years    obviously my sample was sent to a lab due to reporting i take pregabalin yet my screen and my lab came back negative  i ve researched as much as i can but literally find no cases with a false negative unless the person wasn t taking the drug or otherwise tampered with the sample  even a rapid metabolizer wouldn t show up negative when sent to an actual lab for that special testing they do for confirmation  i know the drug is in the capsules as it continues to manage my pain to some degree and if i miss a dose  the nerve pain is unreal and improves after taking it  has this happened to anyone else here 
would appreciate some help for the above please   i m hoping to get onto a clinical trials research phd but would like to apply for specialty training for the relevant specialty as well   hypothetically if i was to get an offer and accept it  would it be possible to tell them i am doing a phd and will start the training upon completion   thanks in advance for help on a niche question

dear longs   i wanted to help with broadening our collective understanding of several things that may be happening behind the cydy curtain      cydy may still be finalizing irb approvals at the various investigational sites that are being targeted for the hiv chronic inflammation trial  i mentioned this before but it takes time to get things through the irb process and if everything went perfectly the first patient could be enrolled mid late june  we will see      costs for those trials are tethered to exactly what biomarkers are being studied  we are aware of two main inflammation markers  crp and engage  according to a recent post by u mgk he quoted dr  jl as stating   and a host of other biomarkers   i just did a general search for the cost of engage and lots of other info came up but not a direct cost tied to engage  i spoke to my primary care physician recently and asked if he knew about interluekins  he was aware but was not sure if they had a test that he could order  he looked at his computer and they did have a blood test he could order  but it was not covered by insurance  he did tell me it was close to    k to test for the interluekins  i declined but it got me thinking about all of the unusual biomarkers that cydy will be studying and how much it might cost per blood test  so i copied and pasted my standard blood test done recently and all of the associated costs  take a look     this is standard stuff   my   blood work       laboratory   general classification     total                 hc albumin  urine other  quant          cpt               hc      lactoferrin detect stl          cpt              hc cbc w auto diff          cpt               hc venipuncture          cpt              hc urine routine micro          cpt               hc psa total          cpt               hc lipid panel   calculated ld          cpt               hc free t           cpt               hc highly sensitiv tsh          cpt               hc c reactive protein          cpt               hc metabolic pnl comp          cpt               hc creatinine urine          cpt               hc esr automated          cpt              you can see that for standard testing it is       and crp was      by itself  the less standard a biomarker is  the more expensive it probably is  including the    k for the interleukins  so i would imagine theengage  cd  and cd s and whatever other  host  of biomarkers will add up pretty quickly  so i am making an informed assumption that each blood test for the    participants in the hiv chronic inflammation trial is going to be close to    k      k  let us start with    k per patient per test  that is      million  i believe that at a minimum cydy will have to do a baseline test  an interim test at    weeks  and a final test at    weeks  that puts our test total at      million  this does not include any funding towards the institution  clinic  administering the blood tests and administering the ll doses  plus  hiring the cro to make sure study protocols are followed and all electronic files are updated and in compliance with fda standards  lastly  somebody has to pay for the dsmb  and that is always the sponsor and i have no idea what those folks get paid  therefore  my final estimate is this trial will cost cydy anywhere from      mil to      mil  i hope i am completely wrong  but the minimum of      million comes from just the testing which is critical to our trial      what else is happening behind the cydy curtain        from the beginning of my time investing in cydy  i screamed for funding from barda  hhs  nih  and any foundation with money  np responded once to all of us  not me  and said government grants would slow us down  i truly believe the gov t was not going to grant any funds to someone who has been convicted of a crime  obviously  we don t have to worry about that anymore and dr  jl has a whole presentation to nih on his quest website  it is not a leap to suggest that dr  jl is trying to get some nih grant money for pasc   getting grants to fund research trials is nothing new or novel  just look at our friends at vir  the very basis of their key studies were all funded by a variety of grants but mostly the gates foundation  therefore  it is easy to understand that a study like pasc should be funded by nih  especially since the biden administration publicized a very large amount of funding to nih for pasc long haulers    it takes a lot of groundwork to get funding from nih and you have to make a strong detailed case to receive a grant from them  i believe this is what cydy is working on behind the scenes and having mitch work on the costs is paramount in requesting this amount  otto yang and dr  jl are banging out a suitable protocol and cyrus might be working with potential partners and or a suitable cro to execute the study  all of these things have to be costed out and this would take a lot of time  what gives me pause on this study is what are we going to measure as success   i feel like to a certain extent  i would want to understand the outcomes of the hiv chronic inflammation trial before proceeding with pasc  but we may have some of those answers already as u mgk pointed out in his post the other day  dr  jl stated that they went to the nash study and pulled evidence from there as to ll s moa on inflammation  so maybe there is enough evidence there to promote a successful pasc study using nih funds       we are all curious about the glioblastoma  also known as glioblastoma multiforme  gbm   mouse study at montefore einstein hospital in ny  i believe we will not hear anything soon  why  several reasons   a  this trial has three arms and two of those arms used a merck drug  i believe the drug is   temodar   nonetheless  we never heard the results from mda on keytruda and ll in mice but we are very aware a study took place   if merck is involved with this gbm study in any way  we may not hear because of that reason alone  until such time merck announces a partnership of some kind  which is what i am hoping for    b  most scientific journals as a general rule despise data being bantered about in public before it is published  it greatly diminishes the need to read the scientific journal if the data is out in public already  so most researchers respect the scientific journal s requirement not to let data out to the public before publication   c  some researchers also keep quiet about their research and don t let info out to the public because they don t want others to perform a validation study so closely on the heels of the publication of their manuscript  they want the scientific community to have time to absorb the details and the work that went into the original study before it gets reinforced or refuted      who knows what could be happening with long lasting ll  i am sure that dr  sacha and dr  hansen are busy trying to move that project forward      still more manuscripts need to be finalized and then submitted for publication  as a reminder  once a manuscript is accepted  reviewed  and approved it takes     months  in cardiology  to get published  not sure what scientific journals cydy has submitted to  but no matter what scientific journal manuscripts are submitted to there is a line of other manuscripts waiting for approval and publication   we will know when we see the publications and not anytime soon      lastily    cydy is moving at the pace that a company with limited funding and limited resources can move at  it is a slow pace and a step by step pace  i know it hurts all of us longs to see the share price as low as it is  but i and many many other longs have never associated the sp with the value of leronlimab  i know the story up until today and when the rest of the world knows the story the sp will change accordingly  please note  the final chapters are being written now  the trials that definitively prove the worth of ll  have not been written yet  those chapters prior have only been a tease of sorts  earlier chapters of the story have only proved  provocative   the chapters that will be written will change everything for all of us and imo the story of ll will be bigger than keytruda and humira combined   as my dear friend  who used to be a stockbroker  once said when your favorite stock went down in price   don t get sore buy some more    i love the longs  i love leronlimab  i love long lasting ll and i love dr  lalezari    go livimmune

hey op   coincidentally  i recently made a short video on youtube about clinical trials    i am a youtuber that makes topics about lifesciences  business and history and i made an explainer on clinical trials and probability of success with the various phases    please let me know your thoughts    link to video  https   youtu be zeinltrljnu link to channel  https   www youtube com c chiraaglathia  thanks  chiraag
this is a great idea  i m curious if you ve started creating any content  i ve actually heard of people just talking about their healthcare journeys on tiktok going viral  would love to chat and maybe collaborate on something 
my team will be launching the clinical trials for dummies book on our stronger together   clinical trials facebook page next week  look for it  we ll be posting illustrations  pages  charts and the entire book as a digital download 
i m in a clinical trials program at portland community college  nice to meet you
thanks  looks like a good piece to have a discussion about  i ll read it later tonight 
hey chiraag  greta content and power point slides to guide the discussion  i think this video has a great pacing and good simplified information  definitely along the lines of the original post theme   what a coincidence that your upload timing was so close  haha  my only take on it to make it even easier to digest and easier to produce would be to break it down into even smaller digestible chunks     mins as an overview can be a lot to process for a newbie  what if we could abridge it  and then have more bite sized clips with specifics on the channel if they want to dig further    awesome contribution 
hey chiraag  nice channel  i m curious  how did you decide to go with youtube  have you tried any other channels 
hey  thanks for watching    what other channels would you suggest  i recently started a twitter as well  i figured youtube would be a good way to visually convey complex topics 
i think tiktok would be a fantastic channel to try   it s going to push you to be super concise and funny  i enjoy this guy s videos skit format as a nice example   https   www tiktok com  admani  explains lang en  https   www tiktok com  admani explains lang en 
what type of thoughts are you looking for  study design  results  the treatment being studied 
all of the above if posible  or any feedback you may have about the study  does it look promising  critiques and things to be aware of 
it s possible in asia pacific as long as your father can attend the subject visit and there s no language barrier to communicate with site staffs 
the simple answer is yes  have you looked at the nih  nci  and nhi 
what an excellent post  about the only thing i possibly can add is a mention of phase    from what i ve read from various u s  fda based descriptions        phase       exploratory study involving very limited human exposure to the drug  with no therapeutic or diagnostic goals  for example  screening studies  microdose studies     https   www clinicaltrials gov ct  help glossary phase    and   the purpose of this phase is to help speed up and streamline the drug approval process    https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed               i would mention that there are detractors to this phase  whose concerns are spelled out in this article   fda introduces new phase   for clinical trials   oncology times  https   journals lww com oncology times fulltext            fda introduces new phase   for clinical trials    aspx wt mc id hpxadx        xmp   
how do i apply 
a lot of times the site doctor can get the sponsor of the trial to pay for transportation  you just need to ask or imply that participating will be difficult without help 
thanks  mom s willing to take me     for     of the take 
also  it s not just paying for transportation  it s actually getting there  do you think the niaid would send somebody to my house to pick me up and then take me home 
they would pay for uber taxi  but yes
well  the trial i just tried to apply for said no  and it turns out that i don t qualify anyway because my vyvanse would cause failed drug screens 
well   uncomfortable  probably means  not meeting inclusion criteria   you ll need far more detailed information to find out if someone is eligible for open clinical trials  so he can best ask his doctor 
this company s website allows you to search for clinical trials  https   www antidote me
i am not but i ran into them a year or so ago at sxsw before i was diagnosed with melanoma in situ  it looked and sounded really promising   i didn t realize they were still in clinical trials 
that s awesome that you can get in  
i read an article about the vaccine itself when i first got diagnosed i didn t even know they were giving it to people in trials  i m hoping it helps it seems like it has great results so far from the information my doctor gave me  my doctor is in a bigger city but still surprised it was offered 
i m hoping it works  i didn t even know they were doing trials  my doctor is in a bigger city but still wasn t expecting it  he mainly wants me to do it because i m only    and he wants to give me my best chances 
it s amazing for sure 
rinvoq has been pretty amazing  works very quickly and is also very effective  it s the first medication that raw numbers wise gets a higher response rate than infliximab  remicade    the side effects sound bad  but they re applied to a class of drugs  the older generation of jak inhibitors were pan jak inhibitors and had more side effects  rinvoq is selective and targets mostly jak   so has a better safety profile  this matters because blocking the jak   pathway is where the bleeding and clotting risks are from   i d really suggest talking over the safety profile with the doctor or since you re in the hospital a clinical pharmacist  they can discuss what s been seen in rinvoq only and which ones are from the pan jak inhibitors 
i haven t actually heard of xeljanz   i ve just started rinvoq myself  but from what i ve seen it seems to work quite well for many people who have failed at least one biologic  i have high hopes for myself but i m only   days in haha  from what i ve read the biggest side effect people have with it is acne  all i know about pregnancy and this drug is not to take it if pregnant  so your girl will be      fine in that regard    i d highly suggest searching rinvoq upadacitinib on this sub and seeing other peoples experiences  it was what pushed me to choose this drug 
rinvoq got my symptoms in control in like   weeks  we ve had to fart around with dosage a few times  but its been great  had some acne as a side effect  not sure how applicable that will be with the little one though   as far as the pregnancy stuff     with this med  probably not  from what i understand it failed some pretty early studies as to safety of the fetus  but at the same time  by the time this is in the cards for her  there will likely be several additional options in play    trust antimodez on this one  i m operating off of very weak second hand knowledge here haha 
no advices   i m way too new to all of this to know much   but i just wanted to say you re a good mom   
i ve been on xeljanz about   or so years now  it s been a game changer  i m technically in remission  only some microscopic inflammation on biopsy  and have pretty much no limitations  i get my bloodwork and did get some vaccines prior to starting  but it s been great to go back to a pill after shots and infusions 
i m not on either of those  but i have heard good things about them working  also  you can t apparently develop antibodies to them  so you don t have to necessarily worry about if she goes off of it will it give her an allergic reaction later on if she tries to use it again   the pregnancy concern  i don t know if i quite understand your question  she s   years old are you worried if she has to take the medication for the rest of her life that she won t be able to have kids while she s on it because of risk to fetus  that might be valid but more studies are needed i think   if you re worried that somehow taking those meds will make her infertile later on  i would be very very very shocked if that was a risk  it actually seems pretty unlikely for that to be the case at all   i had a massive flare when i was pregnant had to do a colonoscopy and everything  took prednisone  was not fun but my daughter is totally fine 
  welcome to r crohnsdisease        join our discord  https   discord gg vwghb qdww  if you re looking for people to chat with        have you checked out our rules   https   www reddit com r crohnsdisease wiki rules      are you asking a frequently asked question   https   www reddit com r crohnsdisease wiki ibd faq     please remember we are not doctors and any medical advice is a suggestion   if the event of an emergency  please contact your doctor  hospital  or emergency services    thanks and we hope you make friends here     i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r crohnsdisease  if you have any questions or concerns  
i m glad that she went through the scope well and was happy doing it  i ve had crohns for    years  i ve enever heard of either of the meds that you mentioned the doctor starting on  i would definitely ask the doctor how this could affect her fertility in the future    as a little side information i can tell you about my experience with pregnancy and this disease   i got pregnant before i found out i had crohns  i found out that i had crohns because the pregnancy hormone changes caused me to go into my first flare  i have a friend with crohns and   kids  she flared with each of her pregnancies    it is a toss up sometimes the disease gets better during pregnancy and sometimes it gets much worse 
in a phase   there are always some  oopsie  pregnancies where for whatever reason people get pregnant even when they don t plan to and are advised against it  looking at those in the rinvoq phase   none of them ended up with any issues but it s obviously a small sample size   in animal models there were issues with rinvoq and pregnancies  they also push dosages in animals to   x greater doses than in humans  i  think  in the animal models some at human dose showed issues but i know the rate was dose dependent   none of that is to say rinvoq is or isn t safe  it s more currently we just don t have the data to say definitively and we have data that says it s safe and we have data to say it s not safe  as every study ends with  more research is needed  before we can say either way with any level of confidence 
    out of     patients have opted to continue with the open label extension  love to hear it

tissues is right answer

what else was in like question   as a whole   
not the last last question i mean question   as a wholeeee last question
that s it bro  that s the last question 
bro i mean all of question   not the last last question yk how question   the last question and has multiple parts to it and thats the last part of the whole paper  
i don t get it  what phrase are you punning off of 
wat
there was an attempt
huh 
a lot of words    just for a bad pun  doesn t even work 
long story ending in bad  or good  depending on your pov  pun is known as a shaggy dog story  i really like them  sadly  i don t get the reference here so joke is meaningless to me

it s incredibly patient specific  zoloft helped me more than anything  i ve tried tms  two full rounds  i ve tried ketamine therapy and other things  but that information doesn t do you any good  tms may help you  it helps many people    if you don t want to try zoloft first  you ll have to get tms from a different provider  some tms clinics take all kinds of insurance  shop around  good luck  hang in there 
i m doubtful about this  access to unlimited infrastructure and devices  and think that you re biting off more than you can chew  i think you should start with one study and prove you can do that well without the university s resources before you get overly ambitious running multiple sites 
i would look into using an e source system  such as crio  not just uploading files to a sharepoint or florence    it would make your site attractive to decentralized rbm remote monitoring which saves sponsors money  may forego some in person monitoring visits  and allows your monitors to close queries between visits which may help your query rates   the same for using an e reg system  and not just uploading to florence  again  
adopting an all in one site based technology would be my first step   look at crio if you do not already know it 
a lot of this depends on therapeutic area  i ve done everything from stroke studies  where you just need enough staff to be on call overnight  to phase one oncology  where you have     people on any given doa  at a small site  you re doing everything contracts  budgets  regulatory  patient visits  data cleaning  monitoring visits    i m working with a few small sites at the moment and a pattern i ve noticed is that they don t know what they don t know  things that seem obvious singing and dating icfs  signing and dating doas  maintaining source  recording test results  timely data entry  are all issues i see regularly    so first i d recommend paying a bit above market rate to ensure you get a few knowledgeable staff members  you probably know a lot  but you definitely don t know everything  finding another person or two with a lot of experience will help    focus on quality over quantity  it s really hard to change ingrained work habits  culture  so it s important to start with high standards  invest in training newer or less experienced staff members   i also like the recommendation of starting small  you don t want to bite off more than you can chew and end up with a bad reputation or       also highly recommend getting familiar with sites like veeva  versa trials  and redcap  advarra  if you re doing any investigator initiated research 
do you have experience with contracts 
which therapeutic area are you looking to cover  for oncology please have hrct  mri  and bone scan  echo and muga is necessary as well  basically anthing that constitutes a comprehensive health care should be there 
yes  i m the responsible person for our current site contracts and budgets  and i ve worked with some huge sponsors and negotiated favorable budgets for us 
that is half the battle  sites work so hard   scope of work is always expanding as trial operational plans are finalized 
i hear the rumblings  big progress is coming    waiting for the first wave   thanks mgk 
we have the right man for the job  i am very thankful he is our leader  we will prevail  we will succeed 
without cinsistaint material news  the sp will flounder wroght with great price swings  unfortunately their is nothing shareholders can do but wait  hopefully  q  will be the beginning of a sustained news cycle  allowing nondilutjng funding and a steady increase on sp    th company is a tangled ball of string with jl holding one end in hand trying to sort out the mess  imo  the mess is too complicated for one man  it will take a bo to straighten out the tangled mess  
i wish we stop crucifying np all the time  i am not denied he make many mistakes but so jl  bp  and many others as well as the previous bod   so far many analysis and predictions dates  posted here are wrong and so np s  so nobody know crap until we know the end of the story   no more fantasy goals  the table is not set yet  i hope the next trial will be the last to prove finally that leronlimab is one of the best for many illness  as an investor here  long  i can not wait for my money back and for this drug to be use around the world  until then i will thank np for the amazing opportunity to be here and more if finally this company prove me i wasn t wrong all this time 
mgk this story is almost too far fetched to make a movie out of   i have been schooled throughout this process   i believed the former ceo  nader and thought we were a slam dunk with hiv per his communication   i continue to believe we have something very special  but i also believe our stock price will be held down until we have a big name partner or produce stellar results   it does not matter what other news comes out  as we are continually pushed down   i would think the pharma community world has to see the extreme potential of leronlimab   i know our day is coming  but it just seems to be kicked continuously down the road   if we can t do it with this team than no one can   nice synopsis of our history and thank you as always for your contribution to the longs 
oh mgk  what you say is so  so true  there is a huge parallel here between what has befallen leronlimab and the present amoral immoral state the world is in today  but honestly  i don t think those involved in attacking and hindering leronlimab necessarily disbelieve in the drug   they just don t care   but i agree  we re in better hands now with jl at the helm  beginning with cyrus the moral tide has shifted  and dr jay s selection  and his agreeing to come on board  is reflective of that   it ll take time  but we will reach the mountaintop where leronlimab deserves to be 
indeed    what a long  strange trip it s been    jg
too too good    thats why like all great things it is trying to be put on the shelf for another generation to be forgotten   but for some reason i think we have finally put together a team that won t let that happen    it s sad so many people have passed away that still could be with us today  hopefully this will end soon and some doctors will step up and say  this drug is amazing      
religion has nothing to do with the founding of this country  they spoke of separation of church and state and freedom for all people no matter their religion  i m not sure what that has to do with my investment anyway 
never bring a knife to a gun fight   i am an above average student of history   went to a school because it was named after a great president   know this     what we own they want   and they   who might they be you ask    will do anything to trip up this mission either for their control of ll or the death of ll  our offence   dr j   co  our defense   sidley austin   co  so we are protecting the ball and our need is to get a first down  we will  then we need a touch down  we will  once we get the first td  we will kick ass and take no prisoners  as you allude mgk  maybe the other or our team deflated the ball  it is our job to get over it and run them over  my rant is over   for now  standing by 
good weekend my friend   r g
i agree with ra    i do believe in tangible items like the prospects for leronlimab because the science is there and we have evidence for it s value  intangible human made gods have no substance or verifiability  morality and integrity are most assuredly not due to people having religion 
from the declaration of independence  creator is a synonym for god   separation of power refers to your right to participate in the religion of your choice without interference from government  or to choose to be an atheist  it also keeps religion from interfering with politics   we hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights  that among these are life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  
religion had everything to do with the founding of this country  the pilgrims  william penn  maryland  missionaries establishing churches which grew into settlements and cities   we hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are   endowed by their creator   with certain unalienable rights   days of fasting and prayer declared by our first presidents       america would not have been founded by atheists because they would mock the idea of rights coming from the flying spaghetti monster  aka  god  our creator may have  seemingly  nothing to do with the success of our investment  but he has everything to do with the founding of this country  re  the separation of church and state  that phrase came out of a letter  one letter   from thomas jefferson to his cousin  the judeo christian tradition defines the founding of this nation like no other nation on earth  and we separate it from our present past at our peril 
for the record   if we are speaking about history  our finest president ever was stuck on the west side of the potomac  he had retreated there to lick his wounds  the brits had kicked his ass from li to where he was  it was christmas  his troops were demoralized  freezing and starving  the plan  get across the river and attack the hessian mercenaries in trenton  his conscripts contract was up january   meaning what was left of his army might be gone  decision made   john glover and his marblehead men transported all troops on christmas eve across the river  then they marched to trenton   far later than planned so they lost the advantage of darkness  by divine intervention  circumstance and weather protected them from discovery  they set up at trenton and won the battle   i believe we lost two lads   hessians lost hundreds  that moment is when we regained our mojo and here we stand thanks to the lads   washington  his brave soldiers  the marblehead fisherman with john glover as leader  i would say its good to be lucky which we were but that luck on that day was devine  we will win this  standing by   locked and loaded
i would agree with you but the country was formed by men who believed in a creator therefor it was a part of the founding of this country  but i ve met men who are atheist and honest and have integrity  and men who are hypocrites and hide behind their religion  integrity to me is a spiritual concept not a religious concept and you can be spiritual and not have a belief in religion 
agree  except it does not really keep religion from interfering with politics 
religion has nothing to do with investments in cydy  let s keep the religion and politics out of an investment discussion 
my creator may not be the same definition as your creator  people shouldn t state beliefs as if they are universally accepted or believed 
that s why everybody has a choice and we live in america
i think we understand that  but i m not sure about those who want to think their religious beliefs should be everybody s belief even through political laws and directives    love and let live   leave it out of discussions about what s wrong with my investments

for a complete iris kidney disease staging  you need creatinine levels  sdma  upcr  and blood pressure 
it wouldn t be a bad idea to see an internal medicine specialist to investigate your dog s case further in my opinion 
based on just the information provided your pet is in iris stage    barely  almost stage    with proteinuria  i agree and sdma and blood pressure are indicated to complete the staging  early stage   doesn t usually come with clinical signs that are noticeable but that s not a hard and fast rule  the other commenter is likely hinting at the possibility of hyperadrenocortisicm causing the increase pu pd  low usg  and increased alp   i agree that considering other differentials is warranted given the details we have above  it is very possible that the issues you are facing are secondary to ckd stage    however  like i said you usually don t see severe pu pd this early on and azotemia  increased creatine and bun  can be caused by non renal factors  so there is very much a possibility that this is a non renal azotemia secondary to a different disease that just looks like kidney disease  a follow up with your vet or internal medicine is not a bad idea if you d be willing to continue with more diagnostics 
thanks  can you say anything about the other questions  am i doing the right thing  am i doing all the right things  what else can i do  what can i expect  will symptoms improve or not worsen or just worsen more slowly or       
can you say more about why further investigations  imaging   might be indicated  or  like  what you re getting at exactly  
thanks  the vet was quite chill about the whole thing and only very casually mentioned imaging as an option if i wanted it but he didn t say why it might be indicated or that there was a possibility of differential diagnosis  the ckd was presented as  the  diagnosis   if i had known imaging might reveal anything that would change the treatment plan and prognosis i would have gone ahead right away    i had wondered about other possibilities myself but he sounded very certain it was simply ckd and he even said given her age he was surprised it had taken this long  that normally dogs get it younger than        fwiw he also wasn t super clear about the dietary restrictions going forward or what to expect  hence my feeling a bit clueless and posting here   i m definitely feeling like i want more information now     i think i will ask for an ultrasound 
ideally  you d get the rest of the testing done and then go from there  without knowing the exact stage advice and interpretation would be premature  if you want the best care  i d second going to see an internal medicine specialist 
i m not allowed to hint at diagnoses on this sub as i m not a verified user  but i think it might be worth it having a look further with a specialist to be sure not to miss anything if you have the capacity to do so  internal medicine specialists are amazing at diagnosing and managing complex diseases and it s possible that the alp could be indicative of something else going on for example
ckd may very well be the true diagnosis  we are just saying there are other diseases that can cause similar signs and similar lab results  imaging is not wrong but may not provide a definitive diagnosis either 
the  clinicaltrials gov  https   classic clinicaltrials gov ct  show nct         term palizade draw    id is nct                 it s a massive trial      us locations and a bunch of other countries    thanks for the reference and good luck to you 
oh and keep us filled in as things progress  i made a new post flair called clinical trial and assigned it to this post  hope that s okay
will do 
darn  i bet next theyll debunk the oxytocin or bone health
this looks right up my alley  thanks

the clinical research rift in psychology remains pervasive  clinicians know there are many many ways   some even metaphorical    for humans to understand their internal landscapes in order to change  ifs is simply a way to observe internal conflicts rather than get caught up in them  it will work for some people who have this problem 
the problem with ifs isn t that it can t work  we simply don t know because hardly any research has been done  the problem is that they make extraordinary claims without any evidence to substantiate them  and that s a giant red flag  another giant red flag is that there hasn t been any meaningful attempt to empirically examine the intervention over the last    years since its creation in the      s   contrast that with cbt  which was also developed around that time  the reason it is a well established treatment is because its claims and concepts are falsifiable  and there have been over       studies providing a wealth of data supporting it as an effective treatment for numerous different disorders  i had difficulty finding one study on ifs  and it was a pilot study  op was able to locate three studies  the difference in scientific rigor here is night and day  and if psychology is to be taken seriously as a  science   we can t in good faith contemplate interventions that have almost no scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness   so what would i like to see in terms of studies examining ifs  all of the above  clinical observation and coding for basic theoretical concepts is needed  factor analysis of core concepts  what are the sub factors  and what are they related to  are they distinct concepts  or new names for existing constructs  qualitative data from patients  not website testimonials  about their experiences and how they are similar or different from other modalities of treatment  with thematic analysis to determine commonalities across participants  single case experimental designs to see if functional impairment and distress actually improve meaningfully  and to what extent those improvements are durable  systematic case studies to see whether those outcomes at least generalize across clinicians and providers   those are the things that should be happening first  essential theoretical work  what few studies do exist have skipped all that and gone straight to the end stages of treatment comparison before we ve even established the validity of basic ifs concepts  another giant red flag   so start at the beginning  build an actual scientific foundation  and see if there is anything there at all to even compare to other treatments  only after doing all that should we even consider studies like public health   ethnographic research  process outcome studies  and rct s   efficacy trials  and then if  those  studies also support the intervention  it makes sense to carry out effectiveness trials  i e   standardized treatment in typical community environments   once we have somewhere around        intervention studies  then a meta analysis makes sense  and then we can start making some claims about the overall effectiveness of the intervention   but it seems the creators of ifs don t care much for science  at least not over the past    years  they d rather just claim on their website that  ifs is frequently used as an evidence based psychotherapy   https   ifs institute com   without having done the actual work to substantiate it  this is fraudulent behavior in the scientific field  just glancing at one of their  publications  raises even more red flags   https   foundationifs org images banners pdf journal for self leadership deland pdf  published in the  journal for self leadership   which doesn t appear to be an independent journal  so they published this paper through their own journal  not normal  not independent peer review  not scientific  let s look at the references  only    citations for a   pg manuscript  also odd  and    of those citations are previous  publications  by the creator of ifs  schwartz  r  c    an astounding     self reference rate  this  study  is a house of cards   okay  so all of this  looks  scientific  and they make lots of scientific claims  but a cursory glance reveals lots and lots of unscientific process  we have a word for this in the field   pseudoscience

nothing   it simply isn t science and is fundamentally flawed  there is no reason to try and make anything out of it   blood from a stone 
you can t make a marbe sculpture from a pile of shit  the human mind is not made up of subpersonalities  a theory with this assumption fails automatically 
this is a good response  i m trained in ifs and use it with clients and on myself  but i don t pretend that it s somehow  evidence based  nor do i hold out much hope that it will be   i personally believe that the benefits of it are mostly  if not entirely  due to the mindfulness component and view the protocols as essentially a form of guided meditation  the concept of  unblending  from parts is reminiscent of the practice of cognitive defusion from act 
i think to begin brainstorming  you make a great point about new language for existing constructs  i believe that this treatment could be justified as a sort of ancillary tool to existing treatment as opposed to an entire modality in that  parts work  already exists ad nauseum in psychodynamic psychoanalytic circles  with shown effectiveness but lack of data on mechanism of change due to their claims of uniqueness of each provider relationship   to integrate parts is simply not a useful treatment target in my opinion for the vast majority of people  and to artificially force a person to discover a priori parts might be damaging if done with a sense of authority   e g   science tells us you have have a firefighter part  versus the clinician using it as an internal tool to recognize and structure treatment around experiential avoidance   the concept of recognizing and labeling thoughts which promote avoidance tendencies is already a core feature of all modern psychotherapies to my knowledge  whether that is acknowledged as a mechanism of change or not    in my area  there are so many therapists using ifs i feel like i could find a convenience qualitative sample quickly lol  i don t think we should underplay the level of anecdotal evidence in that way   so many people saying they ve benefitted should be a sign that a real qual analysis needs to be shown in the literature  in that  i think to contrast your red flag with a green flag  the fact that ifs has gained popularity as a working tool for eating disorder clinics is especially interesting  since this population has a known relapse rate and poor prognosis  there is a mystery there   why do these clinicians find this method especially useful  why was cbt or other models not enough  maybe the author s marketing was amazing and it s bunk  but then again  maybe this method opens up an area for work that has real clinical use  i know that s an oversimplification but a study that explores those factors could be interesting    agree with the self reference and extreme claims as pseudoscience  it does seem the author was more interested in cashing out quickly on his experience level rather than taking some mutually agreed upon steps to establish his model  i don t know why behaviorists and spiritualists can t just get along  in my mind they meld together perfectly  the observable and the mystery of internal experience  so why does one have to deny the other   i appreciate your insight and will be saving it for future reference as a fellow skeptic of the treatment 
how is it fundamentally flawed and what do you mean by  it simply isn t science  
it doesn t describe did  it s more of a gestalt perspective  have you seriously never developed a professional persona  or experienced an inner conflict 
i think ifs is about noticing patterns of cognitive and emotional behavior and using a metaphor of different subpersonalities to describe them  rather than stating outright that each human has multiple distinct subpersonalities  but i could be wrong 
both of those phenomena are better explained by valid theories   
the human mind is not divided into distinct drives  the metaphor is wrong 
one of these theories is contextual behavioral science  which describes  contextual selves  and indeed has a strong research base for this  people act differently in different situations  even to an extreme degree  and their ability to do this is seen as healthy  whereas overattachment to self processes is considered often ineffective  is it really a  better explanation  when it s very hard to use that info in the clinical session  and often cited as the hardest act process to employ  i think ifs is not an explanation per se  but a clinical tool to help clients track internal experiences and link those experiences to external phenomenon more effectively  like i already stated in my post  there is an entire study which links ifs to preexisting legitimate treatment methods at its theoretical core  what literature would you need to see to know that ifs has a theoretical tone that could indeed be valid 
okay  do you have a link to some information about a more evidence based model of the human mind that i can read about  genuinely interested 
people act differently in different situations  because  by definition  the situation is the main determinant of behavior   attribution error  
there are some different models depending on your specific interest and the type of model developed fits them accordingly  taylor and fiske have a model of a  cognitive miser     social cognition theory  might be the books name  in which the human mind is viewed as a computer more or less  michael billig has a metaphor for the human mind as a debate or argument that he proposed in  arguing and thinking   psycholinguists use a model that resembles a neural neutwork  steven pinker has written about that in his book  words and rules     searching those terms will provide you with alternative sources and studies  but i would say those books are a good starting point regardless   if you have trouble accessing any of these then send me a msg and i will make sure you can access them 
you don t believe that in different contexts people engage thoroughly different mental models  you do realize there could be an opposite bias to attribution error  like an overestimation of external factors  maybe we can call that the ecological fallacy  if that s true  what would even be the point of talk therapy at all     
why would they engage thoroughly different   mental models   perhaps different situations call for different mental models  i will not think about shooting a basketball if i am currently typing a reddit comment  oh nevermind  i just did while writing  why  because of the situation  i needed an example so i came up with one  why basketball  who the fuck knows   i know about prothagora s maxim  but you cannot overestimate external factors  by definition  means by definition    talk therapy works because your interpretation of a situation can change how you view it  that doesn t mean it is more important than the situation  because the situation still fucking determines the  mental models  available 
ability to access memories  basketball  is not the same process as engaging a mental model  we re not talking about amnesiac nor tertiary dissociation  your ability to engage a memory is not evidence of a separate mental model because they are not mutually exclusive  while playing guitar  i am engaging a significant and involved mental model of my behavior  but can still remember that i need to change the laundry   conflating my proposal of engagement in ecological fallacy when analyzing human behavior is not protagoras maxim and has its own unique operational definition     you cannot overestimate external factors  followed by  your interpretation of a situation can change how you view it  and in so result in a new behavior  almost like internal factors can influence the external world  so it would be possible to either overestimate how much so distal external influences are impacting internal responses and vice versa 
 removed 
i made an argument for a claim  attribution error  and you countered with a contradictory claim  every topoi has a logoi and anti logoi    internal factors  once again by definition  cannot effect external factors  your perception of it  sure  but that is still stuck within the limits of  internal   you cannot manifest knowledge abpout psychology  you have to interact with it in hopes of attaining some   of course it can be overestimated  but you are not arguing anything concretely  i would once again point to the attribution error  and this time to it being labeled as  fundamental   another clue   to conclude  you can use pseudoscience all you want and use whatever concoction of delusions for pragmatic purposes  i believe i am a good person  for example

for this field to work  you have to step beyond simply arguments of logic  you even say yourself  internal consistency is not observable coherence  to which i agree  not sure why you re on this sub if you value logic over the whole value of human existence and an attempt to connect beyond inherent isolation  psychology isn t just about science it s about helping people live valuable and fulfilling lives  and yes  there s elements to that that cannot be justified with logical arguments  but we re out here doing our best  if you want to observe and contribute to the science of truly known and concrete phenomena be my guest  but don t think about trying to apply your positivistic principles to even the most behavioral of treatments  because your clients will truly suffer  even in the only remaining behavioral treatment left standing  behavioral activation for depression  guess what  they still value the relationship and recommend what  oh  support counseling rogerian humanistic counseling at it s core  you can t escape that element and maybe people who try to escape that element don t really belong in the field of applied psych aka helping 
t  diabetes varies moderately in prevalence but it is found in every part of the world  the implication that it may be forestalled by a routine vaccination is groundless and dangerous  please stop 
oh yay  a new  cure   these never get old  i do  but they don t    years baby    years
i was in the faustmam trial   i have a lot of bcg scars   i was hopeful it was doing something  it was not
my t  diabetes was cured by eating a cinnamon roll
faustmann again  she s barking up the wrong tree  no evidence of any reduction in autoimmunity  there s a minor metabolic benefit  but that s it 
dangerous nonsense  i m torn between saying delete this post so you stop spreading this crap or leave it up so you can be rightly ridiculed for everyone to see 
can you point me to any papers rebuking this study 
it s not even new  faustman has been playing the  poor rebel outsider  and raising money from patients and families who lack the scientific literacy to evaluate the chances of success for something like a decade  if not longer   she presented her long awaited from the first study at ada several years back  almost getting banned in the process because she violated policies governing papers being presented   and they were underwhelming to put it mildly    i ve even seen ads recruiting patients with other autoimmune conditions for bcg studies  which is borderline unethical given that no effect on autoimmunity was demonstrated in her published studies    while the data did show a measurable decrease in insulin needs  i m not sure it rises to the level of being clinically significant beyond demonstrating that making the immune system work increases non insulin mediated glucose metabolism  and that those effects can be somewhat durable 
cinnamon outweighs the glaze  works even better if you sprinkle it on top of the roll and then inhale it  beats afrezza in lowering bg   s
what are you doing in your lab  do you have a lab 
you haven t linked any peer reviewed study  you linked a video interview that s has no review process for anything said   if you don t mind me asking where is your general homeland  i d love to look into the t d statistics myself   from the video    n stage patients are patients who have had diabetes for weeks and months   that s still well within the honeymoon phase for most people   and before you start with the  just do your research   you ve made an incredible and bold claim with no proof  the burden of proof lies with the claimant 
have you ever met spoken to her   sometimes communication can help clarify misunderstandings      
i m building new mathematical models of insulin mediated glucose metabolism    math i developed and derived is powering thousands of closed loop systems worldwide  some full closed loop     but  i bet you thought you were just talking to some chump on the interwebs and not a person who s actively involved in research and developing solutions to better manage diabetes 
i was in the trial  i have spoken with her many times   it did not help   now they re following me to see if it will help with covid   it doesn t
your work sounds fascinating  can you share more about the mathematical models you ve developed for insulin mediated glucose metabolism  how do these models improve the management of diabetes in closed loop systems 
you on aaps or iaps 
would love to learn more can you share more details  i don t think you are a chump i just think that good things come when all parties work together towards a solution  i personally am of the school of thought go give it a shot so many major cures medicines and impactful technologies happen in ways we had little to no understanding of until much later  many were accidental discoveries so if anyone is trying anything im always curious and hopeful  i did research when i was at university years ago  and a   year old i love dearly was diagnosed so i m doing research again  her options are incredibly limited due to her age but any data helps 
thank you for being in the trial  without people like you  researchers and all of us looking at  working on  and making attempts we would not progress towards a solution   cure  hopefully with ai and data from trials like the one you participated in  the time to a cure will be drastically reduced 
they re based on modeling how actual well controlled t ds in real life dose their insulin  rather than strictly following the instructions and equations given by their doctors  and the radical assumption that those people actually know what they are doing   collecting true pivotal data is difficult  but the bulk of anecdotal reports show a reduction in time above and below range by         along with a corresponding reduction is standard deviation and coefficient of variation  that s in a group of patients that already exceed ada targets overall with regard to their glycemic management  putting them in the top      of all people living with t d  meaning there s less room for improvement  there s a reason that almost every pump study compares the pump against mdi  and i ll give betabionics credit for having the stones to include people already using aid in their pivotal study  even if the results showed no overall improvement  and some people seeing a worsening of control  in that group    with a few more refinements to the model  systems based on it should be able to hit      tir running without any human input at all  and exceed     with ilet style meal announcements  there s also potential for handling exercise better  reducing the risk of exercise induced hypos    all of the results so far have just been based on shoehorning the math into an existing algorithm that was already the equivalent of any commercial system  my ultimate goal is to build an entirely new algorithm from the ground up around the core equations   because the new math allows for better predictions as to the effects insulin will have  the system can dose more aggressively  and calculate that it s likely safe to do so  resulting in fewer  shorter highs and fewer corresponding lows  and yes  there are limits to how high you can get and be able to come down in a reasonable time without a corresponding low   if the system gives too much insulin  or the insulin is more effective than expected due to external factors  that can be detected as well  and detected earlier  and the user alerted   have a snack in the next    minutes or so  vs sucking down juice boxes and slamming candy when the cgm alerts to the impending hypo  and winding up on a rollercoaster    and yes  if you re wondering  at times i feel like i ve done a goddamn endocrinology fellowship over the last two years working all of this stuff out  digging through the published literature  and making it fit together with the existing body of evidence and knowledge    for more  presentations are available online  the initial research  since refined significantly  was presented at ddata in november of       i ve since done presentations at cukrzykca tech fest  an online polish diabetes tech conference   a presentation for the loop and learn group on fb  and a  doctalk presentation for dedoc 
my work is in both  but i m personally using aaps   
the entire body of faustman s work is based on the observation that rates of t d are lower in countries that still regularly administer the bcg vaccine    ignoring alternate explanations for the observed phenomenon  she latched onto the idea that the vaccine could somehow  reset  the immune system  which any competent immunologist will tell you is not how things work     she did a study  the results of which showed a modest reduction in a c and insulin requirements  but no restoration of natural insulin production  the overall effect is basically the equivalent of giving someone with t d metformin   based on that  work along that pathway should have been redirected to identifying how it has that effect  rather than continuing to push the idea that it was going to somehow cure t d    instead  faustman continues to push the idea of the bcg vaccine causing an  immune reset  or having some other immunomodulatory effect  going so far as to study using the vaccine in patients with other autoimmune diseases  the ad i saw recruiting patients was for a fibromyalgia study  and it took clicking through quite a bit to find out that she was involved   that honestly borders on unethical  as do some of her fundraising tactics  i ve seen the emails she s sent to people continuing to tout it as a potential cure    would i get the bcg vaccine if a doctor offered it to me  sure  there s evidence of a modest benefit and the risk is minimal  but  i m a legally competent adult  at least  chronologically  and capable of making an informed decision  i question the ethics of continuing the research in children  and i m honestly surprised that the research was approved   is there any evidence  even from faustman  that there s any potential for it to be a cure  the answer to that is a clear  no   is it possible that the metabolic effects reduce the chances of seroconversion and the development of t d autoantibodies  probably  the question is by how much  and whether that potential benefit outweighs the risks and costs of the intervention    to take that a step further  there are likely specific genotypes  hla dq  comes to mind  that might see a greater reduction in risk  but widespread screening is not  at this point  financially realistic for society  and studies on the scale required to detect any signal in the noise and establish those correlations with any degree of certainty are probably not feasible at this point in the investigative process   has faustman contributed to the overall body of knowledge  undoubtedly  her results actually provide some underlying evidence to support the overall grand unified theory i m working on when viewed in the correct context  and it may be that in the future  we can identify people at elevated risk for developing t d and reduce that risk based on her work  that  combined with things that we know work to slow the progression of the disease  like tzield and incretin mimetics  once autoantibodies develop  may significantly extend the period of time that higher risk individuals have prior to developing clinical diabetes  but it ain t there yet 
interesting  i wish there was more basic layman explanation on how to start from the ground up with aaps  docs are  well   deeply  documented  between ns  xdrip  aaps the learning curve is insane  most the doc libraries i know are easier to digest lol   out of curiosity  i got a few questions if it doesn t bother    what s more in the math models than insulin carbs curves   predictions     why there s no use  that i know of  of smartwatches sensors  like fitness trackers  to include bg variation from someone doing sports 
the curves you see are the results of all the math and predictions  which the system then uses to determine what to do  the idea being to get to target as quickly as possible while minimizing the risk of a low  change the math  and those prediction lines change    as to pulling in activity data from smartwatches and other wearables  there are people working on it  and experimental branches that are playing around with bringing it in  afaik  they re not far enough along to have made it into the main dev branch for eventual inclusion into main yet  though 
i mean  they re really isn t much that you can do in your situation  it sucks and turnover rate is high in aba  but it really isn t in your control nor is it appropriate to say something to the parents based off of something you feel i understand where you re coming from full heartedly  i feel like there s two routes  you could go speak up about the situation to your managers in the clinic or i would call out some coworkers that i know could do a better job or just keep doing what you re doing if you re willing to stick it out but just because other people aren t doing their job doesn t mean you need to make up for it in your session you can only do so much and you don t want to ruin what you have between you and your client because it s gonna take a long time to get back to where you were before then and you don t know how long this understaffing problem will be and if you get staffed up again  then you just put you and your client in a bad place together because they re gonna associate you with that high demand maybe talk to the bcba about how many trials you should be running
i ve honestly experienced the same thing so many times in my career  i don t really have any answers for you other than do your best to prioritize your clients  needs    make sure you re referring to the ethical code and best practices to inform your decisions  lean on your supervisor  and ultimately it s up to sr leadership to explain why progress is or isn t happening so defer to them if you get confronted 
armenia cannot afford to go back to the ways of kocharyan  sargsyan  and russia  it will be the end of the country
amazing how the arf s response to the kremlin arresting and transferring their friends and allies in artsakh to azerbaijan was doubling down on helping the kremlin    the best and most respected among them just got sold out by vlad for no sensible reason and they re still doing the dirty work of forces that offer promises of a secure armenia while securely delivering whatever they are given charge of to genocidal dictators   i couldn t stand some of the guys that were transferred  they were idiots  our idiots  but idiots  which is dangerous  but it turns out their friends are even dumber for abandoning them    as to respond to aram sargsyan    russia will eventually withdraw fully because they are not ussr and they don t have the power to forcefully stay   it s not that they don t have the power  they have the means and the resources  and they re petty  a reaction that hurts us is always what i m afraid of and why i am seen here supporting a gradualism    but the truth is apart from bullying here or there  they just don t have the cntags  honor  or will to carry out their promises and operate on maximizing short term pursuits as if tomorrow s sun wasn t going to rise  over long term state  trust  and influence building 
lmao final days of the pashinyan government  always great to see the little bits of humor in these
lmao  former officials  and  accused  go hand in hand 
everyone watch eurovision instead of going to that dumb protest  let them see they don t have the support of the people

all you need to know about the current street protests      fsb at its best    notable parties and figures who joined or endorsed the arf church rally  arf s local and international structures  serj s hhk leadership and its  youth wing   kocharyan s  armenia  faction mps  the union of armenians in russia led by pro kremlin ara abrahamyan  russian armenian billionaire ruben vardanyan s aprelu yerkir party  the hayaqve  kocharyan s friend vitaliy balasanyan and other politicians from nagorno karabakh  ex ombudsman arman tatoyan who recently participated in a forum organized by the ex regime  an aspiring revolutionary vazgen manukyan  paruyr hayrikyan  the leadership of radical group bever  several mps representing the pro russian opposition factions in the parliament  mihran poghosyan  suspected of narcotrafficking  hiding in russia   serj s son  naira zohrabyan  singers shprot  andre  sofi mkheyan  mger armenia  and others  
maybe pashinyan resigns and chooses a successor from his party that will continue with the same foreign policy will make the protesters go home 
f eurovision though 
it s not about pashinyan  it s not about the policies   it is about them being back in power  pure and simple 
srbazan hurt his foot walking all day and is now resting up while others do all the work    if that ends up being the reason the protests end  i m going to laugh at them harder than i planned to  but they re probably going to carry around the guy in a palanquin chair or something 
no  we all know that kocharyan  the church  and russia will continue its provocations until they get what they really want  i feel the main reason everyone is mentioning pashinyan is that he is the face of armenia s current policies and if the leader changes but the policy stays the same you know russia and its backers will just convince their audience to go after the new guy 
no if you don t like there are tons of other programs you can watch  this is a popular show in europe therefore a lot of people watch and watching that is endlessly better than attending that dumb protest 
that s probably the excuse they came up with  as they saw it ain t going anywhere 
an excuse  very much so  but the holy marshmallow is so gluttonous and well fed khozik that his foot be bruising up with blue and yellow damaged blood vessels 
lolll holly marshmallow
we really prefer that any studies or surveys are run by the mods first to ensure that users aren t being spammed with requests 
i ve done one  they explained what the trial was about  i did the treatment and follow ups  then i got paid  i m pretty sure i got the placebo arm which was annoying but not the end of the world    what exactly are you trying to figure out 
yes  a few for contact lenses that i can remember     pretty easy  an eye exam  take a survey  wear contacts for two weeks  take a survey  and another eye exam   it was a good few hundred dollars for my time   there s one locally about reducing alcohol intake that i ve kicked around signing up for 
as a research coordinator  getting the women to do it is easy  talking men into it is very difficult   
yes  currently part of  
not clinical  but i did the nih nutrirional precision study  i could not complete the second module because i was so upset with how many flaws there were  i also found it ethically uncomfortable that they had people eating so much food even if they said they were full    i m also a researcher though so i tend to overthink and be very nitpicky over every thing and research  basically i do not make a great research participant     i think when i was an undergrad there was a research institution in the college town i was in but i just never had time to do them    i really do hope that more black people and women get involved in clinic research because we definitely need representation in the science    one of the measures that i m using right now for a study that i m conducting was literally normed and all white europeans  i can t stand it 
i m in one now  i m testing out a skincare product  it seems to be a dupe for an expensive product since the ingredients are almost identical   they sent it by mail and every week they have me fill out a survey and take pictures     they re supposed to be sending a gift card at the end of we do every survey  but i like the product and it seems to be working 
there is a fictional book about clinical trials  really haunting its called lakewood by megan giddings  it s about a protagonist who s a black female who did a clinical trial  should check that out if you re interested   edited for spelling error 
i got emails to do one while i was pregnant but i said immediately no 
no and never fah me    gif  giphy   aggxfslat dp ohs 
hi  totally understand  let me know if you have any questions  i m not conducting a survey or study  i m a journalist 
i m a journalist for a black media outlet  so i m gathering perspectives on what black folks think about clinical trials  especially after covid and our other reasons to mistrust the medical industry at large 
in the context of the rule  there s really no difference between a journalist conducting interviews and an academic conducting a study  next time please contact us beforehand 
i see  my perspective is skewed because i studied public health and was a healthcare researcher for years before my current profession  i wouldn t say i have mistrust in the industry at large knowing the crazy amount of bureaucracy that goes into these trials  covid was a once in a lifetime global event and i understand why they had to move fast    clinical trials in general suffer from a lack of promotion to underrepresented groups  honestly they need to pay more so that there s more data on how things affect people like us 
idk about canada but most places in america give you zero support  so if it s anything like here you ll just have to figure it out yourself anyways 
no not worth it  sleep doc was useless  the only reason i m successful is the apneaboard forum and the youtube channel the lanky lefty     check out both  the guy who has the yt channel runs his own sleep business  i can t think of his actual title off hand 
no it s not worth it  head over the apneaboard forum and install and sd card into the machine  i self titrate and it s saved my life   
resmed    machine models do everything the model    does but does not advise the doc of your usage compliance via its modem   the model   s cost about  u    to     bought online from cpap or cpapx or cpapsupplies or lota on line 
it s probably more worthwhile to be more invested in your own care and figure out how to do the adjustments yourself   airsense     you hold the radial dial and home buttons for a few seconds to enter the clinician s menu   airsense     hold the two large square buttons on the touchscreen for a few seconds to do the same   once there  you can play around with the pressure all you like   setup isn t that particularly difficult   your clinic will be very unlikely to be of any useful help   there are many communities  here  apneaboard  cpaptalk  etc  that can help you get started   clinics here  in canada  are a fucking racket   they re only trying to make a markup by referring you to buying machines that should be priced nowhere near what they should be selling it for 
if you are buying a resmed  you will probably use the auto cpap function  because resmed s is pretty great  and never actually need to adjust it   if you need to adjust it  you can do it yourself using these instructions   https   www apneaboard com resmed airsense    setup info  having said that  the adjustment challenge is knowing what to adjust it to   the therapist may be useful for identifying changes  but since you are looking at the resmed  it will likely be set to auto      and never touched again 
where i canada because ontario ohip covers     of a basic machine remed    what i got with an upgraded mask cost me      i don t have private insurance
get the     it is tried and true  follow nick at cpap reviews or jason at thelankylefty    both on yt on how to self optimize one s treatment using oscar or nick s sleephq  oscar is free https   www sleepfiles com oscar   seen online pricing card to cloud in the cad     range  heated tube is recommended   check pricing at sleepeh ca cpapoutlet ca monstercpap ca cpapmachines ca cpapsupply ca sleepyeti com  calgary i think    card to cloud model is cheapest for the     modem model costs a bit more  but allows u to use myair app  oscar uses sd card 
i love my      no reason to buy the newer model 
if you have no issue doing trial and error and are fine with making adjustments get the     you can get an sd card and save your data that way 
adjustments are free 
if you re still having problems check out apneaboard forum on the web and the lanky lefty    on youtube  without both of them i wouldn t be were i am today  i told my doc everything they told me and she ignored it all  haven t been back since and chugging along nicely every night 
agree     
in alberta   i tried looking into government coverage  there is a way but many hoops to jump through to get it  it s time consuming and still not guarantee you get it
awesome thank you   since the    does not have the card  does that mean i would not be able to use oscar  or does it send the data wirelessly
   should have its own a sd card  if not  u should can get any sd card   gb or larger     has some issues like poor humidifier tank design   hard to use if u have arthritis  it is easy tip over     has a swivel tube connector which i luv     has issues with its tube connector   see nick s vids 
https   www reddit com r semaglutide s nba  wwv n  it says semaglutide  but check this user s posts  they posts a bunch of clinical trials for all weight loss meds and the requirements  there are some without comorbidities 
currently on the trial in australia  it s the best thing ever   really works unbelievable i ve lost nearly   kg in   weeks
the part that annoys me is that all the trials i find are for conditions other than t d or you have to have t d and be obese  weird to not have switchers as a test cohort that are at normal weight 
you can research it 
many of these are almost over  i have been to that site several times  you need to filter for active  recruiting and not yet recruiting  
i did compounded tirzepeatide for about    weeks last year and lost    pounds  if it s even better than that  i could hit my goal weight in     months 
thanks     
this user is pretty on top of it  normally updates their posts too  was posting just last week the week before with new  recruiting trials 
let s put it near      void juice  https   images cdn  gag com photo ao pm n    b jpg 
i d recommend looking up clinical trial coordinator positions and seeing what they require for education

this is probably a pipe dream  gastritis is not a life threatening condition in itself and i m sure stem cell therapy is expensive  so good luck getting insurance to cover it 
i d be willing to try it if it had a high success rate  at this point i would drink piss if it meant my stomach would be healed forever    
i would empty my savings if stem cell treatment was available 
yeahh you might be right

not feeling bad for voting against all the board and their pay  the only thing i voted for was their accounting firm
at this rate they will go bankrupt in   years  each quarter burning cash of   million will last for    quarter ie     years   out of   million they had spend     million to convince us for reverse split   fire larry we need competent ceo
view in your timezone     thursday  may           at       pm et             https   timee io         t     tl zomedica   announces   first   quarter          financial   results  a   revenue   up           to            million  b           gross   margin  c   and           million   in   liquidity
stock tanks on good news  love it
sweets for the sweets  sugar for the honey     can it get any sweeter as zomedicas truforma  truview  vetguardian  the artificial intelligence  and more new assays sell in the united states and now europe     we are going to be rich   this is the best quarterly ever     gamestop did it  and so can we    after all  people may love their games  but they love their pets more   gamestop was headed for bankruptcy  then out of nowhere they took off and millionaires were made   zomedica is doing great and doing what s expected   they have more than proven themselves  and now  at this point  all they have to do is sell  manufacture and distribute  and keep up appearances    to the moon  and good job larry and his team   
  million total outflow    million cash      m revenue    million cash   either way  they need to start making money soon 
this isn t good news   more revenue but increasing debt and now only     million liquid   that sucks   they are burning    million a quarter now   it was    million a quarter 
my guy  this is nothing like gamestop  far from it  just because a company has products the investors like doesn t mean the buyers like it  they literally cannot give away truforma  the vomiting and diarrhea panel  maybe if the veterinarian doesn t have eyes to see the excrement and ears so they can t listen to the owner it would be helpful  maybe expansion into europe would be cool if anyone gave a shit about the products  fun fact  idexx has been in europe and asia for about   years now  they give away their analyzers as well for a volume commitment  they also do wayyyy more than vomiting and diarrhea  can run up to    chemistry assays on one run and sample of blood  just because zom is now allowed to sell overseas doesn t mean they will  idexx has spent hundreds of millions to develop that market and the likes of zomedica aren t going to even create a wave over there  your shark  larry doesn t want in that pool  his pockets are not nearly deep enough and there isn t any revenue to make it worth their while  so they rely on a dying breed of distribution reps to push their shit and not get paid for pushing it  good luck everyone  the thought of even breaking even at this point is hilarious 
   million liquidity balance down to   million
so  their current runway is well under   year now   guess they ll start looking to extend their runway  fairly soon  if they haven t already started 
the last smile it seems will be idexx as zomedica enters europe with the only animal analyzer that detects the lowest frequency on the planet using baw technology   truforma has     patents and    patents pending that will protect our state of the art analyzer and no one can copy it   if you do not have bulk acoustic wave in an analyzer  then you don t have an analyzer that is the most reliable     pulsevet however is the reason we will hit    million in revenue which is what we need to make profit and soar  and we are almost there   the rest of the products is the gravy    go get  em larry   europe is waiting     keep in mind that no matter what happens we never vote yes to a reverse split  this is how you get rich is by owning a large number of shares    to the      moon     ps   idexx is giving all their analyzers away for free just like zomedica is   analyzer s main source of income is through the ongoing revenue generated through the sale of the cartridges     so  we are not the one s giving an analyser away for free    everybody s doing it  and if their not  they better   
i m an elf from a little village  forgive me   what does  current runway  mean   lol
can you please point to the studies and white papers proving the most reliable and accurate baw tech  to blindly state it s the most reliable and accurate without proof is at best poor judgement on your part 
time before their cash runs out since they are operating at a loss and burning cash reserves
the burden of proof is yours  but seeing s how you do so much by getting back to us here on reddit with all you see out there in the animal health industry  i can at least do some research again  and to my dismay  i worded it wrong    because baw operates at a high frequency  it has a very low limit of detection allowing these changes to be measured down to fewer than    picograms per milliliter   i had read somewhere baw is the lowest limit of detection  but until i find that info  wherever it might be  i will restrict my comment to low limits and not the lowest on the planet  and that s good enough don t you think   you re keeping me sharp  i ll give you that     but baw is great technology  and we are the only animal analyzer that houses this concept    to the usa moon and the european   
we will hit profit by the end of        but by some chance we do not then we will soon   zomedica is too big now not to be successful 
i m not the one spouting this being the greatest tech because of xy or z with no proof  i m asking you for the proof to prove the point that until there is public information about the accuracy and reliability of this tech in veterinary medicine we don t know exactly shit  this is science we re talking about and the proof is found thru the fundamentals of the scientific process  and having the lowest threshold for measurements isn t really relevant  there are reference ranges for a reason and measuring in ug pg doesn t change anything other than the unit of measurement  an out of range assay is out of range regardless of the unit  being the only analyzer with this tech isn t necessarily a good thing  if it s soo great why is zomedica the first to pick it up for their suite of equipment  why not any of the other companies  if it s so great they would have seen the potential for it years ago and created their own version or bought this one    your rosy colored glasses are fogging up your ability to think in a remotely logical manner

thanks for sharing this
no idea what your work environment and culture are like  but if you re the new guy  it might be hard to get away with saying no to being asked to support a project  i would just go along with it and look at it as an opportunity to learn something new  especially if there s going to be other technical staff on the project  so the burden won t fall entirely on you  and your compute is sufficient to deal with the data you have  so you can focus on the methods rather than on hacky workarounds 
i m a biostatistician who did dissertation work on ml methods  and worked on some medical imaging  radiology  data projects in grad school    if you already have the data  and can understand glms  then this won t be hard at all for you to pull off  the actual ml model fitting task is in many ways  easier and less rigorous than what we are traditionally used too  it s pretty fun too  just dip your toes into it    many of these so called ml methods were developed by biostatisticians and statisticians specifically for high dimensional data  statisticians wrote  elements of statistical learning    not data scientists    however  if your job is to clean and process raw imaging data  or to make a ml model that can pushed  to production   like you re making an app   then you re going to need some new programming skills that many data scientists have but we aren t trained for    if they want you to use neural networks like cnns or transformers  this is a very expensive and time consuming task   not necessarily harder  but you and your employer should take this into consideration    in general  i would be more concerned about a ml engineer or data scientist having to properly run a survival analysis involving multiple imputation than a statistician doing ml 
honestly  i think it s time you step up  you ve previously mentioned that you have a msc and    years experience  you have the tools to learn and to educate yourself in order to accomplish what you need to  you re being asked to apply n existing method s  not develop a new ml model     now it is reasonable to say you aren t familiar with these methods and will require additional time to get up to speed  it is also reasonable to not be interested in that type of work  but if that is the case then perhaps you re not the right person for the role  however  you are more than qualified to learn on the job 
don t worry about the details for the machine learning models  you can just think of them as the predict function for a lm   but use your statistical thinking to see if there are ways you can add context about uncertainty or employs clever design for improving the efficiency of the studies 
enroll in omscs at gt or mscso at ut austin part time to know more about machine learning and computer science 
that sounds reasonable  thanks a lot for your advice 
fully agreed  thank you 
i will try my best  i just hope the sample size is large enough  yet to be discussed and maybe simulated a priori   i keep thinking of the new tripod ai guidance and hope i am up for it   appreciate your input   edit  i am also worried if r will suffice since i have no experience with python 
for whatever method you re implementing there is almost certainly a package in both r and python that will do it  and if there isn t it s a good opportunity to more learn python

jesus fucking christ  you back up your claim that nazis became democrats by showing that a canadian politician is the granddaughter of a nazi   do you realize that a person is not responsible for their grandparents  beliefs   do you realize that canada is not america   i swear  a room temperature iq would be something for you people to aspire to 
do people really think this of democrats  i m more left than most in my circle  i don t know anyone that thinks the becomes should be forced  i don t know any that seem in anyway like a nazi  the only nazi like behavior i see is in congress and the wealthy  it s not a fight of left vs right  it s the majority of americans against the rich 
idk about the  they became the dems  bit but the differently won the war  in the      s you could walk in to any aerospace research facility to any medical research facility in the world and find ex nazi scientists  nasa  who  the un they were all over the place and in high ranking positions  the ones who were in the medical field should have all been hung just like their counterparts at the nuremberg trials  were talking about people who tortured others in the name of  medical research   it because the research was too valuable they where just placed in government jobs to continue their work 
more so that people looked at the model of nazi germany  thought it was genius and incorporated it to their own beliefs and ideology   i think at the end of this each identity group will have its own nazi germany to live in 
authority isn t automatically nazism

be strong  liss  speaking from experience  trying to get a medical professional to listen and take a person seriously is so very frustrating  years ago  i came down with a strange rash that looked like a mild case of chickenpox and itched so bad i was tearing up my skin  dr said i had  zits   on my back  legs and stomach   and  needed to wash better   three weeks later  as the last few pustules started to dry up  it came back twice as bad  dr said i had scabies  i told him that i have had scabies and this was not it  as the last few pustules on this round started to dry up  it came back again with a vengeance  dr took pictures and sent to a dermatologist who said he had  no clue   dr shrugged and said   can t help you  and walked out  i went through these outbreaks every early summer for   years  each episode worse than the last  i have a degree in microbiology and have a microscope  so decided to do my own research  i isolated a spirochete  did hours on hours of research on the american dermatology society website and found a disease  infection that matched my symptoms  but i needed a prescription for the medication to treat it  so i went back to my doctor  when i told him about what i had found  he got angry  livid actually  with me  threw the printout across the desk without even reading it  and told me how very tired he was of  house syndrome   named after the tv show with hugh laurie   told me that   when you hear hoofbeats  think horses and not zebras   i told him that i was sure at this point that we have ruled out horses  they say that it takes over   years and more than      doctors before someone with a non  common condition disease  syndrome gets a valid diagnosis  sorry  truly didn t mean to high jack your post  don t give up  do your own research because after your    minutes in the exam room are over  you and your problems are gone from the doctor s mind as if you never existed  wishing you the best outcomes

hey liss thank you for sharing your story  i m glad you feel you can ask for help and are getting the help you need     i m glad you re not suffering in silence  the people who care about you  who really matter  will want to help you  if someone labels you attention seeking   making others cater to you   being a burden  they are not worth your time  fuck them  it took me way too long to ask those close to me for help  and that s when i realized i had been putting my energy and effort in the wrong people  while those who really care and wanted to help just never knew  love yourself  and let the trash take themselves out

you re kind hearted to think of us to let us know what you re going through  i m praying for your wellbeing and health and that you will be well   your experience reminds me alot of the wondersmith  maybe connect with her too    https   www facebook com misswondersmith mibextid lqqj d

liss  you are a boss babe  sounds like you been knocked down again and again but you continue to get up and hold your head up high  take the time you need rest  recover  and snuggles with your animals  as you hold your head up high let this subgroup of all the pretty shinies straighten your crown  might be a crazy thought  have you thought about going to a medical school  some medical schools might do a live case study  for nursing we had act like we had a certain disease  so we had to figure out the symptoms and portray them to the class and they had to guess what it was  this was a way we could learn to recognize certain things so we could help treat people  i wonder if a medical college has something similar but they use real people that have medical disorders diseases  maybe a group of not quite yet doctors have an idea that you could try  food for thought 
we love you liss  thank you for making this community what it is  i am so proud of you for doing what you need to take care of yourself     we will be here when you are ready 
     gentle hugs       and keep being you  being a spoonie is so darn hard  hour by hour  i m learning     years in  to advocate for myself better  which is so hard when we have been brought up to be agreeable and respectful    keep going  sister liss  we ve got your back 
oh my goodness  you ve been so patient with me as i ve wandered through the  land of indecision   i m so glad you are taking care of yourself 
take all the time you need   we miss you but your health comes first 
we love you liss   your health comes first    
take all the time you need  liss  we re all rooting for you
i had pseudotumor cerebri when i was    as well  but mine was due to an allergic reaction to minocycline  commonly prescribed for acne     i also have endo  fibromyalgia  and heds to name a few  chronic pain and chronic illness is so draining physically and emotionally 
we love you  thanks for all you ve done for our community  please take care of yourself       
oh wow  please take care of yourself and start feeling better soon 
shiny rocks can wait around forever  but heath is transient  thank you for your service in this sub  and best of luck 
we re going to be some badass butterflies at the end of all of this 
  hugs   i can t wait for life shit to turn to life manure and give us some gorgeous life flowers 
oh yes  the trifecta  i swear  the moment doctors suspect heds they should immediately test for autonomic dysfunction and mcas  but it is tough when the diagnostic criteria literally is  rule everything else out    there need to be more options out there than the standard   to    because we can absolutely contribute to society  but we need a bunch of naps  five pounds of salt and our ritalin prescriptions to be filled on time

woof  i probably won t have much brain power for a bit  but maybe sometime in the near future i can do an extended q a for the sub if that is something that people will be interested in 
oh  don t you dare apologize  i always look forward to your emails  i m keeping you   
lol one condition was that you were still hers in email  i should say her conditions not that i didn t want you lol 
i m really terrible at managing my own limitations  shocker  but i am trying to be better  luckily i have a devoted husband to yell at me when i m not hydrating enough or working too hard  he may not have any experience with my level of medical insanity but he goes off and does his own research and supports me when i finally concede that i should go to the er   i ll be doing lots of lurking  and hopefully bit by bit get back to being social again  us zebras have a habit of disappearing from the world when we are struggling but i do miss my gem family   
y all made my life so much better when i was in a really tough place  don t think for a moment that you aren t a blessing   
i have a great respect for the amazing doctors that have helped me figure  most  things out  but i also am a firm believer that patients need to be their own best advocates  sadly they are just as human as we are  and they don t have all the information that we have  but enough stubbornness and patience can get results 
i swear  i d be shocked if anyone with heds didn t have extras  i didn t sign up for the whole connective tissue disorder package  please unsubscribe me 
awww  love you too

woooooo weirdly bendy gang unite 
let s take a stand against pots    faints in unison    d
right   it s insane how similar we all are the chain reaction autoimmune issues cause   i keep saying that if i weren t required to work a specific number of hours or set time to do tasks  i would be great  i get interested in so many things  and i love to be busy or create  i just can t do it consistently   if the many different types of people that should just be able to exist and contribute to society  differently   the world would be so much more beautiful  all of those master artists we know by name  most of them made art full time  it s a fantastic avenue for the chronically ill  arts should have more public support  chronically ill people should have more support    if you haven t checked out the musician ren gill  take a look  he has chronic lime  me cfs  and mcas  he writes a lot of music about it and talk about his journey a lot  he just offered me a lot of solace  especially since he s the one who led me to the possibility of mcas  it s simultaneously nice and horrible to know that we aren t alone 
          
hahahaha   aw geez you guys  you re going to have me weeping all over my keyboard in a minute   that being said  i d absolutely not blame you a bit for being horrified at the thought of having to take over managing me  lol     gif  giphy kfxhuy ndwutaubdw  downsized 
remember that zebras disappear best in a herd    let the people you love  and who love you in return  support you in the ways you need  we make each other stronger  so getting better is for both your benefit and the benefit of those around you    something a fellow spoonie taught me was to make a  down for the count  list  whenever i m zapped and need to retreat to my nest  i can share the note with my partner  it s got a list of my usual household responsibilities  like laundry  or vacuuming  plus a few other things that i d likely want to contribute to helping with but know i likely won t be able to for at least a little bit    if anyone offers to help  he refers them to the list  they can pick something off of it  and know they re taking something off my plate that i m otherwise lying in bed feeling guilty about  plus  it reminds my partner of the things that will need a little extra attention while i m not able to tend to them so things don t turn into a surprise problem  it s been really helpful 
the sad thing was that the doctor  who by his own admission   had no idea what was going on with my health  would not even look at the documentation i presented and in fact  actually threw it across the desk while berating me  yes  they are human and therefore can make mistakes  but as you pointed out above  i do have more information about me and my situation than he  and i have more  skin in the game    he wasnt the one looking like a leper with hundreds of horribly itching  open sores weeping yellow pus  people were staring at me in the grocery store and would put distance between us just in case what i had might have been contagious   i am covered with scars as a results  since my money had bought me    minutes of his time and i still had    minutes left  what would have been the harm in just looking at what i had found 
i ve been saying that for years especially with the truly awful drs in my area
https   youtu be e hyepd y e si wwecmhq fz sdkhh
firstly  i m sorry for your diagnosis  good news  as my doctor told me in      when i was diagnosed   there are a lot of tkis  is rare to get resistance from one tki but in case you have it  you can switch to another tki  also  clinical trials are necessary  so no worries  you will get examined very often 
i m a    year old male and was diagnosed a year ago and i m participating in this trial  there is no certainties that the others will work if this one fails  asciminib binds differnt  so other tkis should be an option  there s always that risk tho  ask every question you can think of and if your gut says no then don t  with that being said i m doing excellent and wouldn t even know i had leukemia  no side effects for me  any questions feel free to ask 
hey   first  im sorry to have to  welcome you to the cml club       i got diagnosed back in       ive tried a couple of the meds  and i know several other cml patients as well  so imma be straight up with you   so with asciminib   its been reported that most have said the side effects are actually not as bad as it is on others   its hard to say how it will do on you  because each person reacts differently to each tki   for example  sprycel was hell on me  i was on it for several years as well  while its the worst for me  someone else does fine with it  one person didnt even have side effects on sprycel    if asciminib doesnt work out for you  then yes you could change to sprycel  tasigna  etc etc  i have been offered to take asciminib  i wanted to jump on it  but then i had some health issues so i stayed on tasigna because most of the issues was stomach problems and we didnt want to start a new drug and not know why exactly im sick or whatnot      i know one of the first people to be on asciminib  shes soooo freaking awesome  she failed all the other meds  asciminib saved her life   at that time it was known as abl    in trial   im very lucky and blessed that my cml specialist is one of the top in the field  he was even part of the development of sprycel  and he wants to switch me to it as soon as im ready    so i would  say  go for it  it may be  the best one for you 
hey  i m   m   was diagnosed with cml back in      and since i ve been on all other tkis and my cells became resistant to each one of them overtime  asciminib on other hand has been the only one that s working for me  with surprisingly no side effects  depends on individuals i guess   it s the safest medication i have used for cml personally  living with cml could be hard but you get used to it and like discussed in a previous post  it becomes the new normal 
oh also  i switched from sprycel because i had joint pain in my elbows and had some low key fatigue that got annoying  i have joint pain still on ascinimib but i m hoping it goes away in the next few weeks  i switched meds because i heard good reviews of ascinimib and i thought it would be good to try something different 
i was diagnosed    weeks ago  and just started sprycel  so i can t possibly give an informed opinion  what i do recommend is asking your oncologist these questions about resistance and switching  and making sure you get a satisfactory answer  i ve started writing down my questions in advance so i don t forget about them   if you can t switch to a different class of tki if this one doesn t work  i d be wary 
i got diagnosed   years ago and was on sprycel up until a month ago when i switched to ascinimib  the   mg dose made me incredibly sick with diarrhea and fatigue  they switched me to   mg now and i seem to be handling it much better 
people have answered already  so i ll just add a comment  you re young and there are many options for drugs  you ll likely be just fine  the hardest part for me was just navigating insurance which i was new to 
sorry for your diagnosis   i don t know about your location  but my doctor referred to a scientific paper  i will try to find it   where there was a correlation between clinical trials and survival over time  the paper describes that clinical trials often lead to more thorough check ups and therefore earlier intervention of other issues that might occur during a lifespan   this paper referred to american healthcare  but i think it can be true for most  i would really recommend clinical trials  i ve joined a few and i feel well cared for and i even have a phone number i can call if i have questions between appointments  that is connected to the trials 
i asked the doctor that very question when my sister was getting ready to choose between a clinical trial or sprycel  his answer was that answer was something to learn from the clinical trial  the clinical trial hadn t started around her hospital yet and she would have had to travel a much further distance to participate  so she choose sprycel  she is doing amazing on sprycel  fatigue is her biggest and really only side effect  good luck making a decision  don t stop asking questions  good luck with your treatment

same reason they demonize weed  they don t wanna admit it has numerous benefits and can be used instead of mainstream pills  as is the same with other schedule   drugs most likely

went down there to go to my appt couldn t find them anywhere  call the number given and she said they moved to the dillards parking lot  after walking around for   hours could not find a single person and the help line had no idea

that s nice  but i ve seen so many cures for so many things that are  just around the corner   and the tests were done in      
when out for us to use  timeline
so  this is relatively  new news  and became recent understanding among research teams  even few years back most researches would only focus on recovery of ihc ohc but ignore synapses  now  they realize that without synapse formation you having or missing on ihc ohc is same because nothing would connect them to nerve bundle  essentially you may be getting tinnitus not just because of ohc ihc damage but because of damage loss of synapses  technically brain won t loose connection to ohc ihc because if synapse is intact then connection still remains intact  just sensitivity to frequency is worse  in our case with tinnitus we not only loosing ihc ohc due to damage  but synapses as well  if someone could recover synapses  we could potentially get rid of tinnitus but won t recover hearing fully  if you want actual cure   then ihc ohc and synapses must be recovered   i believe dr  cheng is making a progress towards both ihc ohc   synapse regeneration via gene expression  he did achieve successful trial in shanghai with kids whom were born deaf due to gene mutation  which is not the same as hearing damage  but it is encouraging nonetheless 
hope it goes somewhere
i have hearing loss and tinnitus in my left ear since i was a child due to some ear infections  will this work for me 
what about for those of us without hearing loss  i m beginning to feel like we are the forgotten  and yes  i ve tested  multiple times 
dude  if a lobotomy would fix tinnitus i d be in line 
god speed
   years ago  the ata said there will be a cure for tinnitus soon  where the hell is the cure 
saw this the other day  https   apple news alm irirgtcqenubz bjvbq
synapses and hearing   the synapse is a critical junction where nerve cells  neurons  communicate with each other   in the context of hearing  synapses connect the inner hair cells  ihcs  in the cochlea  the spiral shaped part of the inner ear  to the auditory nerve fibers  when sound waves reach the cochlea  ihcs convert them into electrical signals  which are then transmitted via synapses to the auditory nerve   tinnitus and synaptic damage   tinnitus is the perception of ringing or buzzing in the ears without any external sound source   synaptic damage can disrupt the connection between ihcs and the auditory nerve   if synapses are damaged  there may be no communication between the nerve bundle and ihcs   this disruption could indeed be a leading cause of tinnitus because the brain receives abnormal signals or experiences a lack of input due to damaged synapses  importance of recovering ohc ihc and synapses   to address tinnitus and hearing loss  it s crucial to focus on both   outer hair cells  ohcs   these cells amplify sound signals and contribute to our ability to hear soft sounds  inner hair cells  ihcs   these cells directly transmit signals to the auditory nerve   synapses  repairing damaged synapses is equally important because they facilitate communication between ihcs and nerves   recovery of both ohc ihc and synapses is essential for restoring hearing and potentially alleviating tinnitus  cochlear implants and the   khz   spectrum  cochlear implants are electronic devices that can help people with severe hearing loss or deafness  while current cochlear implants work well  they don t fully replicate natural hearing  the idea of an implant that connects to nerve bundles more naturally and reproduces the full   khz spectrum  a wide range of frequencies  is exciting   such an advanced implant could significantly improve hearing quality and potentially address tinnitus as well  in summary  understanding and repairing synapses are crucial steps toward treating tinnitus and restoring hearing  the development of innovative cochlear implants remains a promising avenue for future advancements in this field
also fluid in the ears damage or ear infections
god please
might need an investigation  who knows    
it ll be ready in     years if it doesn t fail 
there are a myriad of root causes to tinnitus  not just one  not just    or even a dozen    when a small percentile of tinnitus sufferers finds some relief  it s false hope to the rest of us who do not suffer from the same type of tinnitus as those who benefited    they re going to need a lot more research to be able to properly solve cure it for any significant portion of tinnitus sufferers    i m not holding out hope  because there s no profit in it for anyone to cure or treat tinnitus  heck  type   diabetes has been around for decades and millions of people are impacted by it  and they haven t found a cure  though some treatments are promising  with donor islet cells and closed loop monitoring   but those  treatments  are what generates the profit  as long as healthcare and the medical pharma industry has a means to extract a profit  they will    there is no such analogue with tinnitus  other than selling dead end medical tests  expensive masking devices and hearing aids 
you know that nerves heal themselves right  and no its not big part of the problem  the big part of the problem is loud sound damage to the cochlea   hair cells where the inner ear muscles failed to protect the cochlear against loud noise exposure 
you are not wrong  but understanding of hearing issues in      equal almost   and a lot of things were learned since the   i d like to say especially in the past     years really  in the past   years the whole  hearing issues  related research really picked up because currently estimated affected population with hearing loss is    billion and by      it is estimated to double  do your math 
i mean technology has advanced a lot since    years ago  plus it s in higher urgency because more and more young adults and veterans are experiencing it  plus even big researchers from harvard  stanford and other companies around the world have gotten a bigger idea while researching over the last few years  it s been widely known that regenerating hair cells hearing loss has been on the horizon  i ve seen articles recently of kids regaining hearing from genetic hearing loss  so eventually they ll pull through with a way to treat noise induced hearing damage   hair cell loss  tinnitus has had some research also but it s just more complex 
flying cars
lol
well don t count on con man elon musk and neuralink  their first implant has run into problems 
i don t have a clue  after phase ii it has to go through phase iii 
he s been researching all kinds of hearing loss  especially the one caused by damage to the hair cells
absolutely   edit   i have no clue dude 
also how do you cope with it since you ve had it for so long  i ve always had bad hearing but i could still enjoy things until i got tinnitus   months ago 
possibly  the infection could have caused damage in this area that is believed to cause tinnitus  therefore something to regenerate the area somehow would have a chance if the theory is correct 
i did a test as well and she told me my hearing was  within normal levels   but then i read a comment here saying that they had received the same kind of response but discovered hearing loss after testing with higher frequencies    i certainly feel like i hear worse than people in my age cohort  do you know if you tested for higher frequencies as well 
ata is money laundering organization 
where did they say that 
where are you getting that timeline 
while i agree that there are many root causes of tinnitus  majority do share same root cause which is damage loss of ohc ihc and or synapses  i don t agree with what you saying regarding the fact that there is no profit in treatment and cure   i mean you have    b people with hearing loss around the globe and there is very little to no option for these people  companies know that this is literally a gold mine with infinite market value because human population is constantly exposing themselves to noise and what was thought to be and  elderly problem  is now becoming a lot younger and now is being seen in middle aged people more often  it is estimated that    b number will turn in to    b  by       even if cure is found   don t think that they won t have  returning  clients  because people will keep damaging their hearing after recovery and keep going back  at very least military people  law enforcement  people that work at loud factories and etc   i understand that you might of lost hope but you just need to be realistic and while yes there is nothing available now  it does not mean that companies are not interested in finding some sort of solution 
part of the problem is that humans don t have ability to regenerate hearing like non mammals do due to gene suppression after certain point before birth  hence lack of ability to regenerate damage to ohc ihc and synapses  if somehow that gene could get turned back on   it would rebuild what was damaged according to hosts dna 
need to get healthcare out of the corpo nightmare it is in  part of the reason things run so slowly is so they can examine how to maximize all profits too before they begin

cant wait for a cure tbh
if synapses gets damaged   there is no connection between nerve bundle and ohc ihc  therefore it could be the leading cause of tinnitus  in my opinion it is crucial to be able to recover both ohc ihc and synapses to them in order to recover hearing and get rid of tinnitus   unless someone comes up with such cochlear implant that connects to nerves bundle almost naturally and being able to reproduce whole   khz spectrum 
my tinnitus was really low  but now it got louder because of some noise    
i mean  it s hearing loss  you can t regenerate rearing  yet 
i ve lost higher frequencies but it s normal parameters for my age group 
maybe  
it s the ata     mos eisley spaceport 
it s from typical everything is    years away statement 
they ve been trying to cure tinnitus for how many years  it ll always be    years from now 
just to preface  i m just a guy with no real qualifications to talk about any of this  i don t even live in the us   but   while i agree with you on the fact that there are potentially massive gains to be had  the impression that i have is that because of the short term focus of healthcare providers that are listed on the stock market  and because of the inherent risk of a potential treatment failing after having spent a lot of money on it  there might be an understanding that while there is money to be made  no one is really willing to  take the leap    what do you think

sorry to hear that  i got my tinnitus from neglectful american fire alarm policy  it s way unnecessary and dangerous how loud they are here  other countries do just fine at more reasonable volumes 
if the post is correct  there s a theory that instead of the hearing cells dying to cause tinnitus  it s nerve damage along the auditory lines  so it may be possible to heal this before we figure out how to regenerate hearing cells  though i think they ve regenerated cells in some mammals before  reptiles and birds i think can naturally regenerate from hearing loss 
 
same old  same old      see my post  
yes and no  hearing market is virtually empty  but demand i high for some sort of treatment  once dr  shore device gets to the market and if results from trials translate to the  field  then you will see how much hype this subject would receive  it is a massive market  with virtually unlimited cash flow  i think once one of the teams reaches decent results in their trials regarding ihc ohc and synapses   there is going to be literally battle to try to buy them out partner by big pharma companies 
some people just believe everything they see   i ve done enough research now to just understand it ll take decades and decades for anything  it s under funded and tbh  nobody cares

i believe clinical trials have started to test higher doses  could be semaglutide   but i have a feeling higher doses will be coming 
i would search r tirzglutide
a quick google search shows there have been studies  both  for diabetes  https   www acc org latest in cardiology clinical trials                  surpass    and  obesity  https   www gastrojournal org article s                     pdf  where some participants were given    mg of tirzepatide  as others mentioned  there are also ongoing studies with    mg and    mg doses  i personally couldn t imagine such a high dose but it will be interesting to see where things go in the future  my main concern would be for long term side effects that are currently unknown 
people shouldn t admit to it if they have haha   it s definitely capped at   mg for good reason   however  others have stacked glp s or other suppressants   for example taking a low dose of semaglutide mid week on top of your weekly tirzepatide shot   or using phentermine in pill form on top of your tirz   lots of posts around reddit about stacking 
it s tirzepatide   clinical trial for   mg and   mg 
sub doesn t exist anymore 
i see some of the people refer to  rats  i m assuming might be code for experimental stuff lol
nope  my fault forget a letter  r tirzeglutide
possibly but that could be referring to people getting peptides that are technically considered for research use only and not for human consumption   stacking the meds is something legit providers are offering   for example some people get the delayed gastric emptying and regulation of blood sugar insulin from tirzepatide but they don t get good appetite suppression   so their provider gives them phentermine to take with it since it has good suppression effects for alot of people 
wondered about that myself  they say rats and then say  i have no side effects  lol  what s next   code word swim  hah
thanks   didn t notice the missing letter either  and i was surprised   but some of these types of subs have been getting shut down lately for sourcing research
right  
i have to say i was surprised when i looked up ted and saw it was  rare   my question is how lol  i feel like most of us that are diagnosed with a thyroid disorder usually have at least a mild form of associated ted   i was diagnosed with graves and ted about    years ago  and was so upset with the idea of eye decompression surgery   i deal with physical symptoms but they re still manageable  so i haven t opted for a form of treatment yet because it seems like more cons than pros   unless my symptoms become much more severe     i really want there to be more available options  though 
i agree that i don t think ted is as rare as the medical community thinks i think the early or mild to moderate symptoms get dismissed or diagnosed as other things  e g  allergies  i know i was off and on and mildly to moderator affected by both grave s and ted for roughly    years before both got severe enough    for what it s worth  i received tepezza treatment and had ear ringing and muffled hearing in one ear during treatment and for about a year afterward  i wasn t left  thankfully  with any lasting hearing loss 
i m also wondering the same  so commenting for more traction   
i had surgery  graves and ted is in remission and i m living life normally again      
i i have it i was diagnosed in march       i find it odd that post covid  all of these tepezza commercials came out  isn t it funny  where are there is a new disease  there s always a brand new treatment kind of seems planned me not trying to be negative  just trying to speak truth 
totally  truly i don t think it s rare  i feel like it skates by as  rare  because of lack of awareness and a lack of treatment options  orbital decompression story seems so daunting and seems like it should be a last resort for very severe cases  sorry to hear about your symptoms though  it s the worst   
definitely  it was so difficult to get diagnosed  i went to top specialists but they tend to see severe cases  so some of them were unsure because my case isn t that major in terms of bulging  yet  my vision has definitely been affected  even though scans don t show pushing on my optic nerves   did tepezza help you  was it worth it  i m glad it went away but that side effect sounds terrifying  i know there s a class action lawsuit or something about it now 
that s great to hear  i m just not a candidate for surgery 
tepezza helped me a lot i wish i had gotten it sooner  but production was shut down in       i still had to have surgery afterward but i had a severe case with god awful bulging and tepezza treatment meant that the surgery was easier    if you re interested i can  share a link to a discord server for those who have received or will receive tepezza  it might be good for you to read through  everyone s experiences with the side effects varied as much as the disease itself   edit  here s the discord server link it s a good group with lots of good info  https   discord gg e uppum 
that sucks   
sometimes studies have pauses on recruitments for one reason or another  or actually are no longer recruiting  are getting through referrals slowly but surely  etc  you can give it a few weeks and then follow up 
you might also try having your primary care doctor contact the investigator for you  that referral helps
do you have a regular dr that you see for this condition  if so  their office making the call may hold more weight unfortunately 
honestly  we really don t do this at our site  we usually find the potential subjects from among our pi s clinic patients  if they don t get back to you  you could contact the school s irb  institutional review board  they should be responsive even though this would be a strange request  i bet they could get you the pi s information and you could schedule a clinic visit with them to discuss the trial 
i m sorry you re having this trouble  staff at these sites are spread extremely thin so if you don t hear within a couple of weeks  contact them again as it could have just slipped between the cracks    i agree with all of the others  comments and want to recommend that if there is a research consortium on your disease  i would try to establish care as a clinic patient at one of the consortium sites  ideally the lead site if you can  and enroll as a participant in the research consortium  that s the best way to get on their radar  that way they already know everything they need to know about you before you are even screened for the trial  and they know you re interested in being contacted  this makes it easy for them and you ll also be receiving care from a team that is more specialized  well connected and on the cutting edge of the science on your condition   if this is one of the first or only drug therapy trials for the disease  it may be very competitive enrollment unfortunately  often the people who were involved with the natural history studies that would have proceeded the drug trial end up filling all of the available slots  i wish this weren t the case but it s the reality of clinical research at this time    best of luck to you and i hope you are able to get into the study you want 
did you find it on clinicaltrials gov  if so there should be a sponsor contact listed there  if it is a smaller company they will reach out to the site as well and follow up with the site on your behalf assuming it is a smaller enrollment study  if they are enrolling thousands unfortunately it may be challenging  i work for a sponsor in oncology so i can say we would be following up to make sure they connected with you but others it may be too many pts to track if it is say an asthma study  best of luck 
thank you so much everyone for your responses    all of this info and advice is very helpful  much respect to all of you in the industry 
my site has an  ask sitename   portal where you can express this interested  and then you can be put in touch with the crc running the trial  the first step is always getting established as a new patient with an investigator at the hospital  though  so try to see if you can do that even before you re able to get in touch with the coordinator
have you tried contacting the principal investigator directly  if the staff member you ve reached out to hasn t replied yet  i wouldn t count on them getting back to you  how did you find the clinical trial  was it through a recruitment ad or a hospital s research website  if so  you could try searching on clinicaltrials gov  there may be other sites in your area or region that are also conducting the trial who you may have more luck getting in touch with 
what is your condition if you don t mind me asking  i manage a few sites and have some colleagues in the field i can refer you to

hello     i struggle with some confidence issues  ie i feel i m not really smart and perhaps only get to where i am because i work hard and a fraud   most people would not even dare dream about attempting a phd   it is a very impressive feat  and going for a post doc is very impressive as well    feeling like a fraud even though you re doing well is pretty common when you re surrounded by smart people and you yourself are smart enough to understand how complicated something is   sometimes we call this impostor syndrome     i would say that doubt is healthy  and it is better than thinking that you re the best around    all that being said though  do you feel that your issues are bigger at work compared to when you are at home  or with friends or such   are you looking for the kind of confidence and or proof of  smarts  that lets you have power over others  or power over some part of yourself 
similar results  i m also neurodivergent  with a verbal tilt
they administered this test in part to help identify your apparent learning disabilities  your performance being impacted by your problems  whatever they may be  is the point  your working memory score at an    isn t even  poor  in relation to your other scores  a personal weakness  perhaps  but within normal limits and not wildly discrepant from even your highest index of     
bryce exceptional  
thanks for your kind words  honestly  i really think a phd is        project management and writing skills perhaps  probably any one could do one if they can deal with the project management part  obviously not speaking for people who do very technical mathematical etc but mine wasn t very complicated or ground breaking  and it s easy to say these things once you have been through it but definately my phd struggles were related to the organization writing rather than the applied research part   asking this it s more about giving myself confidence power never about other people  i am quite goal orientated and perhaps part of my identity that i associated with that is intelligence competence etc   outside of work  i have struggles but manageable and i m ok with it  mostly related to depression  good at the moment   social anxiety   perhaps maintaining friendships  i do have friends but noted some differences when compared to my siblings  eg all   siblings have kept intouch with childhood friends while i have not  i also moved to canada and would say i have not made any deep friendships although i met my husband and very happily married having met someone here  i know dyspraxia etc has overlaps with asd and everything overlaps hence i like to say i m neurodivergent 
thanks my report does say a discrepancy of this size is found in       of the population and is in the low average range and there is a statistical significance when compared to other aspects of the evaluation 
sorry what is bryce exceptional 
you are welcome   you seem like a reflective person    that can make it harder to be confident  since you consider not only your own perspective and experiences  but it can also give you an edge when it comes to dealing with other people who are having or have had similar experiences   having ideas of what kind of confidence you do not want is good   things like that make it easier to find out what kind of confidence one does want    already being aware of that you do not mainly want power over others speaks to a compassionate aspect   that in addition to your academical prowess  and moving to live in a different country  could perhaps work well to create an inner image of yourself which can instil or bring forth the kind of confidence you want   i have a bias towards psychoanalysis  which often suggests inner work rather than outer work to get to grips with life  there are usually no  quick fixes  of course  and everyone s journey is different    it is nice to hear that you are happily married  is your husband aware of your ideas of confidence   perhaps they also have a few ideas that are much better than what i can come up with  since they know you better 
really  my wmi is    points higher than my psi and even my score difference is on the lower end for a discrepancy according to a poll done on this subreddit the other week
dasdawan
thank you so much for taking the time to give this thoughtful feedback to a stranger on the internet  you are so very appreciated   honestly i ve probably tried       types of therapists including a psychotherapist and just never got anywhere  but you are probably the first person who i ve felt actually tried to personalize it rather than just use generic blanket advice tools and apply it to me without really focusing or addressing my issues    certainly part of the issue is even if i get positive or constructive feedback or praise  i don t really accept it  will dismiss and justify why i m dismissing it   however  if i get negative feedback i take it very personally  i know there is a flaw with this  i ve  read up on how to correct or manage these issues but the actual application and making change is what is i find difficult  and yes i ve tried cbt bur also didn t really work for me   really the issues are probably deeply ingrained and arise from a difficult childhood and relationship with my mom 
you are welcome  and thank you     i want to help a little if i can  but keep in mind that i am just one person   perhaps handling this in a personal way will be the best way to handle it   if you already suspect that the negation of positive feedback and emphasis of negative feedback in you is due to experiences from the past  it might be helpful to try and revisit these   your hunch about your difficult childhood is probably correct  it often is when people have had tough childhoods or a bad relationship with someone  but your experiences are your own   looking back and looking into details of past events is a pretty common way of handling issues like these in jungian psychology  but there are also other schools of thought that would lean towards that or encourage it    now  going back to your past and looking at these experiences that made you feel certain ways will not be easy all of the time  things that made you feel hurt  things that made you feel unfairly treated  and so on   what is important is to allow you to feel the things these memories bring up  and accept them and yourself as you were   remember that they are from your past  and not your present  even if they can affect your present self as it is now    one common method is to think of your past self like a child  while viewing yourself as a more or less more powerful adult even if these things that hurt you didn t necessarily happen exclusively in your childhood    consider things like  if this situation happened to someone else  and you knew what they were going through  how would you view them  if you could tell them something  what would you say   if you could give them something  what would you give   getting the answer to questions like that could take weeks or months to figure out  but sometimes the answer pops into one s mind in mere minutes or even seconds    another thing to consider is whether or not you want to let go of your troubled past  or integrate it into your current self  possibly you could do a little bit of both  but only you can get a feel for what will be right 
love your reviews    and please do not spare us the fangirling when you go and see vadim fumi again   some of us have to live vicariously 
actual post coming later  probably tomorrow but as far as swan lake s concerned  for now   aaaaaah  they
i m at swan lake tonight too    sobbing my eyes out lol  expected
please  please do a review after tonight s performance of sl  this is my dream cast  and i don t have a prayer of seeing it live  reading a comprehensive review is the next best thing to being there  enjoy tonight and throw in a few  bravo s for me  enjoy yourself mightily  and looking forward to reading all about it 
thanks  so looking forward to reading about the performance   
 it s so blatant the role was choreographed on him     i just had a similar experience watching abt do  woolf works   it s amazing how much the physicality and abilities of the particular dancers shape some roles    i am glad you enjoyed yourself here too  could not agree more about joseph sissens 
thank you for taking us along with you 
thanks  love your review  i have mixed views on pantuso but would be interested to see her in this  i wonder if they will end up doing the cinema relay   i ve only been to the roh a few times  but bare feet on seats is a disgrace 
so interesting about the bear   i loved this moment when it came to new york with nobc   it s a notoriously tricky stage direction  and i thought basil twist solved it brilliantly  and i m pretty picky about stage craft  
thank you     well if the people ask for more fangirling    the people shall receive it lmao 
so i read on the balletco forum  incredible  i m going to have to conquer my fear of flying and get across the pond  if these two are cast for r j next year i m there  
it s incredible they are incredible i don t know how they do it
will do    
i agree  watson is a really hard act to follow because his whole look  as well as the extreme bendiness  was what inspired so many choreographers   no one writhed better than him and winters tale is all about the writhing     the rb seems to see ball as a dramatic actor but i think he s a bit too  four square  and conventionally handsome for that  bracewell is a more interesting  type  and i also think vadim is becoming a very good actor and developing more presence with age   which must seem very unfair to the others since he already owns technique  
her youth really served her well here  she was so lovely and fresh   i could not believe what i was seeing       it s a damn opera house  not the beach   people nowadays 
ooo what are your mixed views on pantuso 
i was supposed to be in london this month  but i had to postpone it  so getting to see the royal s swan lake  which was part of the plan  went out the window   because of that  your reviews make me smile even more than they would  otherwise   thanks    
i m here too and they re amazing    those fouettes   
i don t even know how to begin explaining it lol  i can die happy now  may i dare say this is the best swan lake i ve ever seen  
writhe like watson in winter s tale  advice for the ages  d  i haven t seen ball enough to feel like i have a well informed opinion  but i did see him in a streamed  romeo and juliet   with naghdi  and thought he was a phenomenal romeo  maybe he  too  will develop some range with age 
this is probably an unpopular opinion  but i ve always felt that ball is a sort of  jack of all trades  master of none   you can cast him in anything  and he ll be fine  possibly even good  but he s never wowed me    it s telling that   to me  at least   his career has never really taken off the way the rb probably wanted and expected it to  in less than   years as principal  bracewell has eclipsed ball and is proving to actually be what they wanted ball to be 
i haven t seen her live  so my opinion is only based on youtube clips  but  it seems like there s quite a bit of buzz about her  and i don t particularly get it  in the last world ballet day class  i thought her style wasn t very clean by rb standards  too much head movement  maybe   and she was sometimes behind the music  although i thought she had good ballon  she s still young  though  so plenty time for me to change my opinion 
oh noo that sucks   glad to be useful even in this silly small way  
right    they re both killing it soo hard
don t even try it can t be explained  i feel like i m flying rn
i know what you mean   he is very  serviceable  but not exciting   i don t  not book  for him  but i don t book for him either unless he is dancing with someone else i want to see   but i imagine an ad is very grateful for someone handsome and tall enough to partner most ballerinas who can reliably do all the steps of principal roles   that s actually pretty rare  even in the rb
interesting thanks   i have been rooting for her since the erik bruhn prize but rewatched part of the wbd class and definitely see what you mean about being behind in a few combinations 
same    high off of fumi and vadim
girl this third act    
wow wow wow  am on the bus home and still haven t picked up my jaw   fumi served     
no words for real i m shook
oh and the kiss on the lips at the curtain calls    i may have squealed out loud
yes oh my god    confirmation    
yes this was so cute 
well thanks for this 
do you know if they will tell me what my lp a  measurement is  i just got this done a month ago at my gp  but still love collecting any sort of data like that 
considering that i m a relatively healthy guy with astronomically high cholesterol  i m going to have to check this out  thanks 
 you consent to the sharing of personal data  even sensitive personal data   lol i closed up the application after that  how personal and sensitive are we talking here 
they will  you schedule a call in a few weeks and they tell you all of your results  you getting them by email as well 
reading into it  this particular kind is resistant to medication and being genetic  your diet and general health has nothing to do with it  i hope you get some answers 
this is pretty standard language for clinical trials  it s not nefarious    researchers collect a bunch of identifiers  name  address  date of birth  etc   that is considered phi  personal health information  which is protected by hipaa  they also can collect medical history which can be considered  sensitive   in this study  it seems like they at a minimum obtain genetic information about you related to cholesterol   research like this is incredibly regulated  the researchers are required by law to have paperwork with boiler plate language where you sign and give them permission to collect this data from you  store it  analyze it  and share it  generally amongst the research team but sometimes between teams  
i assume they mean your cholesterol results  but it does also give me pause from signing up 
i know i ve got high cholesterol that runs in my family  most of my mom s side is on some kind of medication to manage it  there s definitely a genetic component as i have an okay  not great i admit  but not bad  diet and get regular exercise  if it s resistant to medication then that may not be what i ve got going on  since that has helped me  i ll still check it out for sure though 
from what i understand the purpose is trying to find out the percentage of the population with this variant  they will most likely map everyone that tested positive for it  name and address was really the only thing i needed to input 
nice news  thanks for sharing  i have high hopes for crispr   
jazz bought celator for      bn in       however  even after approval of vyxeos for aml  the insurers refused to cover reimburse jazz for non hct aml patients  if you look and compare the overall survival data including around     of hct hsct  patients vs  the hct patients group  you can pretty much deduce that the benefit is not that great for non hct patients  also  it is very dismal for the control group in the non hct arm   a fiercebiotech article of      mentions an analyst downgrading vyxeos sales forecast for      to around low      m because of slow uptake  in       jazz sales from vyxeos was only around      m  much lower than already lowered expectation following the initial launch and slow uptake  if you can see here  hct hsct allo sct patients often comprise a minority of patient groups in above aml trials  for aml patients that relapse or worsen  it seems to be that the majority is ineligible for hct  i mean  otherwise  they would gotten that treatment earlier on   and for those patients  the outcome has been generally poor  so huge unmet need for the patients included in the currently on going sls regal trial    https   www fiercepharma com marketing jazz vyxeos rollout hit a wall third quarter what s holdup  https   www fiercepharma com marketing jazz vyxeos rollout hit a wall third quarter what s holdup    https   www fiercebiotech com biotech after holiday weekend rumors jazz confirms    b buyout tiny celator  https   www fiercebiotech com biotech after holiday weekend rumors jazz confirms    b buyout tiny celator 
your bp is completely fine for both standing and lying positions  i m not sure why you would be prescribed midodrine to increase your numbers  i take midodrine for my hypotension and i ve had readings of bp where i m at        and        if i were you  i would worry about my bp increasing too much with midodrine 
i am worried  i was perscribed it to try and get my hr down as i ve been running tachy even when supine  the cardio i saw self admitted he didnt know what he was doing when it came to dysautonomia so i m definitely concerned     good to know my bp is fine  i wasn t sure 
blessings my dear  tell him there s nothing to fear  let him spend the remaining time with his kids by his side  you can also setup video calls to families back home to say their goodbyes while he s still aware of his environment  record it all  do not delay  i will give him to the country he s now  where the kids are   no need to take him home  the final days for a young man like him might be traumatic but stay by and stay strong  he would still hear you till the last hour  most importantly let him know you all will surely see him again and when you do  it will be like no time has passed  i feel your sorrows in my bones  may lights guide him home  shalom

that       at the bottom is crazy  hard to understand why it was aproved
i ve thoroughly looked at the dataset in the       claim and it is thoroughly misleading    for one  the analysis provided  does not even compare percent vaccinated to unvaccinated   if      of the population is vaccinated       of deaths will also be vaccinated  for instance  if i have a chart that says      died in group a and         died in group b  but do not mention that group a has      people and group b has           people  it is fairly useless for comparative analysis    second  while the data set does not includes enough information on the  current percent  of the population vaccinated it does include a metric called the  age standardized mortality rate  to compare two populations  keep in mind  the  age standardized mortality rate  is not a  crude rate   instead it s a way to compare health outcomes for each age group   here is a sample data point for an age standardized mortality rate  https   i imgur com vbinvxz png   while i did not look at all months in that window  there seemed to be a massive disparity in the unvaccinated  but again  this is not crude mortality rate   but instead one adjusted for expected outcomes in age groups  the articles i could find that have previously sourced that chart  completely  ignores this metric 
u aren t wrong  but keep in mind this was at the time when the media was saying the hospitals were being over run by the unvaxxed
ca     is just one protein marker  it may or may not indicate cancer recurrence or spread as other issues can elevate it  you say the scans are clear  your doctor will take the test into account and should have more info on that test in your dad s situation 
wow  if it works  this is huge  fmri methods also show some promise 
i m following this closely  i have all the symptoms of early stage cte and the risk factors  but there s other treatable issues it could be  i also have the risk factors for not being able to absorb iron  and my life is miserable enough to want to die anyway   so ruling this out would mean whatever i have can be treated   also  it looks like with cte it s an autoimmune reaction to correctly folded tau  but with alzheimer s it s a prion form of tau  which misfolds other tau into neurotoxins  the only way to stop it is to remove the toxin  which is nearly impossible when the toxin can create more of itself  so i m wondering if some sort of immunosuppressant can prevent damage from cte  like the ones they give to organ transplant recipients 
wow   proud of my country 
i would be interested in knowing  my husband is    years in the nfl and has all the symbols 
indeed  this is honestly the best news i ve read in a while  i can t find anything on joining the study so if anyone has info please share  project enlist https   projectenlist org and clf canada https   www concussionfoundation ca both work closely with camh and may be the ones to reach out to 
i would look to places with large somali populations    i am in minnesota and there are several somali mental health providers here    good first step would just be to google  somali mental health minneapolis  and randomly reach out to someone you find there   they might be able to point you in the right direction 
i can put some feelers out for you  washington is a psypact state  meaning you may not be limited to just wa licensed psychologists  so that should help somewhat  physicians have a similar interstate compact system for reciprocity which wa is also part of  though i m not familiar with specifics  though  maybe your available options depends on how contentious of a case  i e   what s your budget  are you willing to accept a virtual evaluation or are you willing to pay someone to travel    also  is an interpreter needed  it may just add some complicating factors if any testing was indicated  feel free to message me on that if you want 
you may also want to consider reaching out to anthropologists who have studied religious and cultural beliefs and practices of somali communities 
i wonder if uw s global health faculty would have any ideas  this professor is the director of the somali health board   https   globalhealth washington edu faculty ahmed ali  here s their global map filtered by somalia  https   globalhealth washington edu interactive map projects country    
you may need a cultural expert as well 
pittsburgh also has a large somali population
thanks i ve sent out a few leads on that front 
thanks for the input  it s a murder   case so i m pretty confident we can justify the expert funding request and we do not need an interpreter  i ll dm you 
virtual eval or in person preferred 
i d prefer in person but if they are out of state we can definitely do the eval over zoom 
hopefully some of this can shed light on a bunch of other problems  such as me cfs 
finally  
i work in radiation oncology and ditto  the notes are absolutely nuts and very much all over the place bc by the time they get to us  they ve seen    specialists for different reasons related to the issue and there needs to be a sum up of all that  i always need more than the given   hrs to prechart but am afraid to ask  afraid that i ll be seen as inadequate 
oooofffff  have you tried going over your direct manager straight to your senior account manager  normally  sams will just find a reason to fire scribes like that and get a vet scribe from a different clinic to cover once you leave until someone can be trained 
off topic  but how did you land a job as clinical trial coordinator  i am myself a scribe amabassador and looking for crc jobs but to no avail  dont even get interview calls  any tips 
i worked with hem onc  similar experience in terms of having to copy prior notes  they keep it all like its a diary  you don t have to fire the new person  but let the management know this person s progress and your recommendations  ultimately  it is their responsibility to make the final say  so if they decide to keep pushing with her and the provider doesn t like it  it really isn t your fault  they could also move her to another specialty doctor who she might fit with better  you are a truly great soul for wanting what is best for your provider  but outside of training and updating the managers  you might not have much control over the situation  which is ok    if you want training tips  i might suggest      staying after arriving a bit earlier to go over charts      make sure she is writing down notes in regard to new information that she can review      give her some homework assignments   have her search up certain terminology that she misses frequently      see if you can schedule some one on one time with her so she can learn some things outside the pressure of clinic   think of it like an extended pre clinical bridge training 
tell the doctor that you have no control over this and to contact someone from sa 
i would ask your doctor to send her complaint to you and refusal to accept her new scribe in writing  email   then cc your boss and her supervisor  forward it and you can say     dr  xxx is unsatisfied with the quality of work received by      and is refusing them as a primary scribe     then go into all the stuff you ve done to try to help    in working to improve  we have had   training sessions and covered these topics    bullet out the things you tried  for example  screenshared my workflow process for completing note   pasting   difficulties with second language and medical terminology grammatical errors  reviewed note sections yet continues to place imaging results at the top of note with incorrect section yadayada   at my company the doctors refusal of an individual team member is prioritized as urgent  sounds like they need to give her more training resources than any one individual can handle in one off coaching sessions    they hired her  maybe she d be a better fit at a less intense specialty than onco placement  if you like her  perhaps suggest some of her strengths would frame this in a better light for her   excellent at capturing hpi info  would be a good fit for family med  for example  
i m bitter and angry with our management right now so take what i say with a grain of salt  just just take more than two hours  sa can afford it with how much money they re fucking out of us  you have more power than you think  think about what a dumpster fire the hiring process was  management hates going through that  also  your letter of recommendation doesn t come from sa  it comes from your doctor  if management questions you  hide behind your doctor s legs like a shy child and ask them to defend you  assuming you have a good relationship   the two docs i work with would absolutely defend me if i asked them for help 
same  commenting for more info
yeah  my dr loves me and is one of those jock y guys who doesn t care about telling anyone off lolol

how did you get into med school with a      
unl is a big    school which would break the tie in my book   remember  the n on their football helmets stands for knowledge 
do you think it would make a colossal difference in my case where i get it from  sd is significantly cheaper and only    creds compared to    at unl 
phase   research takes absolutely forever to conduct  analyze  and publish  i wouldn t waste my limited summer messing with it  and ultimately  it s boring and it isn t serving you for where you want to go      source  i worked full time in clinical research before med school 
medical students hoping to be rewarded for their work  ie publication  during the length of their time in medical school have no business being involved with clinical trials     even tho rcts are like the gold standard for guiding treatment  and most people don t give a shit about the retrospective shit studies that med students pump out  unfortunately this is how the game is played   
clinical trials like these are not good projects for med students
as someone who spent most of med school running a phase   rct with barely a pub to show for it by application time  i recommend avoiding rcts unless it s where your passion lies  if that is for sure what you want to spend your time on  finding something in pm r would probably be better  pm r is a good specialty for med student research because many of their outcomes  qol scales  mobility tests  etc   and interventions  pt exercises  stretches  aerobic exercise  etc   don t require money 
ask if they have extra data laying around and do a secondary analysis or literature review  takes less time  i agree rct takes a few years to finish and  publish  i worked in research before medical school and published 
not sure i agree with all these comments  y all know op doesn t have to exclusively do this as his only project right
thanks for the input  i think i ll turn it down 
agreed  thanks 
thanks for the input  i ll politely decline his offer
hopefully this answers the questions the luddites over at  r technology has about why this is better than non invasive bcis and other cursor control technologies   for those who did not read the article   his speed and accuracy of control is nearly  x higher than previous world records for assistive technology  and he is able to use the neural link lying down  whereas other assistive technology  like his mouth stylus  he had to use sitting up  which places him at risk of pressure sores  and which meant he needed people to adjust his position regularly to prevent this 
very cool seeing mind controlled mario kart  it really shows that this stuff is more capable than we expected  if it can control mario kart through basic intuition  imagine what it could do with a robot or prosthetic 
it s been     days  knowing personally how long civ games can go  has he finished that round of civ vi he started  or is he doing  one more turn  
wow  any future plans 
the major tech and futuristic subs are weirdly full of tech illiterate and small minded people
i agree but to be fair  there are other technologies that don t involve movement but involve actual brain scanning without it being invasive  there are helmets for example that scan your brain waves  i fully support neuralink s mission but whether having a chip in your brain is significantly better than wearing a helmet scanning your brain waves still remains to be seen 
how long until someone hacks into your chip and controls your body movements 
civ games have an end 
hmm 
the bigger a sub gets  the higher the share of mainstream users who only have surface level information 
when all companies working on headsets have switched to meditation and sentiment analysis  there is not much to support the tech  there have been many promises in the past few years but no one have achieved functional prototypes allowing real use    maybe with some future tech  but at this point it s more fiction that real possibilities 
helmets struggle to get past the skull  notorious for getting in between the brain and other things
i doubt they would be as fast  and the sealed nature of the neuralink means he s not going to get pressure sores on his head for example from a band    he notes that before he needed people to give him his stylus  and i assume someone would have to set him up with a helmet also   neuralink gave him a huge amount of independence  such that he used it for     hrs per week on one occasion 
even if slower i would prefer a helmet rather than a wire being stuck through my brain and the accompanying scar tissue being formed 
just make it nfc or really well encrypted bluetooth  it doesn t need to be accessible except at maintenance intervals 
found the guy that doesn t understand how brains or this technology works 
it does only read  not write signals to the brain 
i ve certainly noticed more luddism on this sub recently 
don t quote me on this but i did see an article paper a few months back regarding using transformers to do brainwave to text  think it was just an initial poc which had      accuracy in a very short amount of training time    if that s refined to say      that s a device i d have no problem dropping    k on as it s far more useful than say apple vr 
bullshit
how is that even a reply  bots are smarter than redditors lately 
anything with a wireless network can be compromised 
compromise my https requests with wpa  security with a    character hash for a password that i rotate weekly
it doesn t need to be connected to the internet  the neuralink chip can work through strictly local signalling  if you don t trust your firewall  you can airgap the computers you connect to your chip 
you have watched a lot of movies lately  haven t you 
the point isn t that you re sacrificing too much but that he isn t willing to save himself  as you said  you also suffer from mental health issues but you got yourself to therapy  take meds etc   you can t make someone do something they don t want to do  it sounds like in the last   years since the near death event  he hasn t made any efforts to get himself out of his hole  it s at the point where you may no longer be supporting him but instead are enabling him   i say this as someone who had a similar relationship 
love isn t supposed to weigh you down and you ll feel the same from your partner  also  you may love someone but that doesn t mean the relationship is healthy  you are essentially his caretaker  the sole provider of emotional support  a fixer  he s supposed to want to be better for you and he doesn t  the only way that he ll get better is if he doesn t have someone doing everything for him which is you 
the last post you made does not sound like you are happy at all in this situation   this post sounds like you convincing yourself that your love is special enough to justify this life you re living with a man who won t help himself   it s your choice and your life but you have to be truly honest with yourself about the situation you re in   also as hard as it is for you to watch this man not help himself improve his situation  that s as hard as it is for people who love you to watch you do the same 
it sounds like you re putting in a lot of effort to make his life better which is admirable  question  is he putting the same amount of effort into making his own life better  do you see him struggling and trying despite his condition  is he seeking professional help and putting in the work to heal and recover  if the answer is no then he probably won t ever    do you want to be his caretaker for the rest of your lives  it s ok if the answer is yes  i d just want you to really think about it 
you say that this is a phase  but he s never going to improve if he doesn t get therapy and or medication    his depression won t magically vanish after you ve told him to brush his teeth the      th time or because you made his favorite meal     you re essentially enabling him  he has no need to change because you ve become his mom  cook  maid  personal assistant  and more  why would he give up all of that to be a fully functional adult and do his own laundry or get a job    as someone who has battled depression and other disorders my whole life  i am speaking from experience     you can love someone and still need to leave them  love isn t enough  your love won t cure him  it can t replace grieving properly and getting treatment for his trauma     the best way to show him that you love him is to make him go to therapy  if he won t  he might if you break up with him because he will see that there are consequences to his actions     are you going to let this trauma laced person father a child off of you  what kind of life would a child have with a dad who ignored them  who never took care of them and was never alone with them  they would feel unloved and unlovable  nothing you say could make them change their mind because the evidence is in front of them everyday  that s a very cruel thing to do     please think about why you would rather be his mom and maid than support his need for professional help 
i find your belief that other people  don t really love their partners  really telling   it seems like rather than being in an equal partnership  you are in a performance  you are proving that your love for him is real and deep  but not holding him responsible for or expecting him to love you the same way   it seems like you are a really strong and sincerely loving person who doesn t believe in giving up on someone you love   but this is not real love  he is not reciprocating  that is why people are telling you to leave  one way unconditional love is not as meaningful as you think it is    you deserve better  maybe consider getting into therapy to work on your self esteem  you have a lot of love and deserve someone who gives it back 
why don t you love yourself as much as you love him  speaking as someone who suffers from severe depression and anxiety if i had an so who helped me the way you do him  i d never even try to get better   the only reason i m even trying to get better now is because my mother needs my help    last year when she was healthy  or at least healthier than she is now  i pretty much gave up and almost checked out  she did everything for me   which ironically made me feel like a loser and that she deserved better than me  i m still depressed and i m not doing more than making it through the day but that s still better than last year    you think your helping him   and you are  you re helping him stay this way   he has no incentive to get better    i wish you luck 
it kind of seems like you enjoy him being totally depends on you  like if he relies on you completely then he will never leave  by chance  do you have anxious attachments 
 i don t believe that there is too much sacrifice for love   holy hell that s a toxic approach to life   it s also weird that you re holding yourself to this standard while completely ok with your boyfriend not sacrificing a single thing for you  but ok 
 the issue here isn t that he s depressed  it s that he s unwilling to do any work to try to help himself     op this is your words  why don t you believe them  the issue has clearly been identified by you  a person cannot successfully help another person who doesn t willingly work to help themselves    keywords are  successfully  and  willingly       being a  healthy supportive partner is doing the  things described above  but to a person who is actively working to heal  seeking professional help  is attempting to live  etc  op the only thing you re not doing for your partner right now is breathing for them   leaving your partner would not be abandoning them in their time of need  unfortunately this great deed that is being done on your part is crippling him     currently your partner doesn t need to  get  better  or have a desire to  get better  because he has everything he needs wants done for him by you 
hadn t ever understood the whole  miss the forest for the trees  analogy but your post just made it clear    it s nice to love someone so much that you re willing to do everything for them  the thing is that when they re gone  what will you have left after dumping everything into a man that  sorry for being insensitive here  but realistically may not have a lot of years left and is not even married to you    nothing  absolutely nothing 
no you are wrong to think that way about everyone  it is something that every people that care for you is telling you  if many people that have no stake in this scenario  and have different life experiences  telling you that you need to walk away  means you are in the wrong   you have a saviour complex  you are ruining your future and when you wake up from your fantasy  it would be too late   love yourself more 
there s helping and there s enabling  you re not helping   you re destroying yourself and you re not helping   you re not helping yourself  you re also not helping him  you re doing the both of you a huge huge huge disservice   altruism and selfishness look sometimes very much alike  you re not doing this for him   and you know what  i don t even know if you re actually sacrificing anything here without gaining something else entirely  you re so proud of the lengths you go to  help  this guy who won t ever find or be able to find a way or a will to help himself because that will get smothered before it can even see the light  it makes me think that you can t actually be by yourself without having somebody to take care of  would you even know what to do with yourself if you weren t serving a gown man or a child  a pet  a sick  elderly relative or anybody else   you re enabling his sickness and you re very proud of it  you find your own value in it     do as you please  but it s not good     eta typos and such
mental illness is a reason  not an excuse  it s very sweet that you re willing to do all of this for him  but he needs to put in the work to better himself also  you re basically a live in caretaker for him more than you are a partner
you might try reading codependent no more
you know there s a middle ground between unconditionally sacrificing everything for him and walking away  right  it sounds like you have gotten to a point where you are enabling him rather than helping    i really think you need to push him to see a doctor to get medication and get into therapy  group therapy for grief and or individual therapy  this isn t sustainable and it will get worse    it sounds like you are a very empathetic  strong and devoted person who is working hard for him and yourself 
i don t see any  we  in your post  i see you carrying the entire load  this is not sustainable for you    my guess is you re projecting your feelings and how you d want to be treated on to him  noble   all that  but he isn t you  he isn t doing anything to improve his problems and you re actually enabling him to be completely static   stuck where he is  so i can see why his family is telling you to leave him  they want him to get better  but he won t can t because you re making it too comfortable for him to wallow in his own misery  you re the biggest impediment to him actually getting better 
  i don t believe that there is too much sacrifice for love    too bad your boyfriend doesn t feel the same way 
you are legit drowning yourself to keep him afloat and are in denial because you say you love him so much and these are the sacrifices we make for our loved ones    but there s going to come a day where you can t care for yourself or you are going through some shit  do you actually think he will snap out of it  step up to help you  i m not saying this shit to be cruel  but you seriously have some blinders on right now 
you should read up on codependency  wishing you peace
i m gonna guess this is ops  first serious relationship  because she thinks everyone else s  just doesn t love their partners enough  that s why they hate her super special loving relationship    the hard reality is that you can t fix someone by  loving them enough  if he s refusing to get any sort of help there s nothing anyone  op included  can do  all she s going to do is waste years of her life by draining her soul to fill his cup    they want op to break up with him because     she is being used weather she lets herself see it or not     sometimes people the boyfriend  need to hit rock bottom in order to change their ways   actually want to help themselves    my advice  don t get married or have his children until he is dedicated to going to therapy for the long haul   is full on   continuing to take his medication s 
congrats on adopting a     month old is he fully potty trained yet 
sweetie  you are enabling his behavior  i m not telling you to care less  i m actually telling you to care more about this situation  he needs to have the moment where he decides that he wants to get better    i was in a similar position as you  my so took a hard hit on his mental health  and i accidentally  by my ignorance  provided everything so that he can stay in his position    i had to let go  and then he started moving  but it was his decision  not mine    you have to let go  i m not saying to break up with him  but stop doing chores for him  get out of this co dependency start the steps towards a healthier relationship  when he starts to do things for himself  it s when he will feel empowered again to overcome his difficulties  action is the best course towards progress  stagnancy is regression  please  keep that in mind    please have professional help  for him and for you  and i wish you the best on the healing journey that s to start    it is a decision and an action  it must come from him    take care 
if you want to stick with him  stick with him  but don t fool yourself that you re helping him  in fact  i d say you re harming him further  he s never going to help himself if you re doing everything for him 
i don t know  will you keep living for him for the rest of your or his life  whichever comes first  i don t know    i feel so uneasy with the way you seem to relish your role of martyr  sounds so extremely melodramatic  and totally unhelpful to any of you  but hey  if you enjoy playing the martyr superhero  knock yourself out    and b  you ask  yes  i ve been in deep depression myself  after experiencing traumatic events 
to steal from another redditor    don t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm      yes he s depressed but so are you  you re doing things for him but he s not doing anything for you    just because someone is in a bad situation doesn t mean that they re not being selfish and taking advantage of others    he s taking advantage of you    love yourself first  you deserve better    https   www psychologytoday com intl blog sense and sensitivity        the familiarity principle attraction amp  https   www healthline com health mental health trauma bonding  https   modelmugging org crime within relationships abusive personality behavior 
this isn t healthy love  sounds like obsession and your ocd is driving it 
the problem isn t that he s depressed the problem is that you re enabling his lows and he isn t forced to get out of it 
you need to walk away from him
you cannot pour from an empty cup  there s only so much you can do for other people  you can t force people to swim  and you should never let someone who s drowning take you under with them 
you are an amazing person to do this for someone you love   i think the concern is coming in because you are sacrificing a lot while it doesn t sound like he s actively working on improving   you don t want to find yourself still doing everything for him    years from now   so it s not that they don t support you helping him  it s that it won t do either of you any good to help him now if he s not willing to at least try   you highlighted   we will get through this   does he agree this is a  we  effort and is he seeking help beyond your care     i don t think you re wrong for standing by someone you love  and your own diagnosis gives you more insight  it should also help you set a boundary so your own mental health doesn t degrade to a level like his  there s nothing wrong with caring for someone  but you need to care for yourself too  just like you care about him  others care about you and don t want to see you spiral or burn out  especially if he s not improving 
everyone just has to wait for you to go through the motions  ne day you will realize they are right  and the man you expect to appear  because you see glimpses of him  will never surface and stay outside  nothing we can say to change your mind 
you seem very invested in making sure everyone sees how much you re sacrificing for love  maybe exmine that  why is it so important for you to save this person at the expense of your own mental health   fyi  that s not what true love is 
seems like everyone is right  your boyfriend is his own anchor around his neck  it won t be long before he drags you down as well 
i believe you when you tell us you re committed to him  and i know you ve been with him a while and he s been there for you when you needed it  i believe that you love him dearly    i m not telling you to leave him  but i do want you to please consider one thing    you can t save people  all you can do is support them while they save themselves    he did the latter for you and that s why you re devoted to him    are you doing the same for him   or are you enabling and or being codependent 
as someone who was in a bad place while my ex sacrificed a lot of his time and mental energy    they re right  you should leave for your own sake  if he has a support system with his family it may be better to rely on that  you can also have an honest conversation about how taking care of him has been affecting you and that perhaps it s time to refer to  professional for help   he ll never stop taking your energy until he gets a big wake up call and good kick in the a ss  i m saying this as the partner who drained my ex mentally
you re his mom now and you re enabling things  trust the people who love you and know you best  you re way too young to be living this caretaker lifestyle  in a couple more years you ll be completely burned out and he may no longer be attracted to you because he sees you as his parent instead of thanking you for your sacrifice  give him a kick in the ass to jumpstart his healing or move on for both your own and his sanity 
you need to have a coming to god meeting with him    you can t love him to health  for y all to survive you need to see him putting in the effort  implementing change and genuinely wanting to get better    you can t help someone who doesn t want it 
look homie  there are reasonable limitations to everything  there is a point where you constantly caring for him may be doing more harm than good  if he s in there  he s going to need to put in the effort to pick himself up     why don t you take a break from the relationship  get out of it and remind yourself what life is like when you aren t a caretaker  force him to have to pick himself back up and do something for himself  it doesn t necessarily mean the permanent end of your relationship      contrary to popular culture  love is not all you need  relationships  and this is even more true of marriages  are hard work  but there needs to be a balance  you re supposed to be a team  if a partner isn t carrying their weight  it s okay to shoulder the burden for a while  but there needs to be a road map in place for how it s going to return to a healthy balance  what you re doing is unsustainable  you will burn out  i know that seeing the end of a relationship is scary and it s going to hurt like hell  but he s in no condition to be a good partner and if you keep this up  you won t be either 
is he doing anything to help himself 
saying  others don t really love their partners  is rather presumptuous  maybe others know to prioritize themselves and love themselves enough to do so   you are prioritizing him to the point of enablement  that s not going to help either of you  ultimately 
as a person with mdd and gad  and as someone with family and friends who also struggle with them too  i get where you re coming from  but also where your friends and family are coming from too  and my advice is that your support isn t enough for your partner to come through this episode  not that you should  or could  be doing more  but that there s an element of wisdom from those saying to walk away  if you interpret what they are saying is that you need to stop enabling the inertia  which by meeting all his physical needs and reminding him to maintain personal hygiene etc  you are inadvertently doing    instead  before you  do  for him  invite him to do the thing with you and introduce a natural consequence if he doesn t engage  eg  if he doesn t want to cook with you  just serve your own plate  don t serve his the next time  just prepare your own meal  he needs to feel like he has some capacity as an adult and while he doesn t have the energy to initiate at this point  he will feel a sense of achievement if he s part of the process   i have a nursing background  and central to the philosophy of modern nursing is that a patient should be cared for by doing as little as possible for the patient so they can maintain their own agency  a simple example of this  immediately after surgery a patient probably can t stand on their own but that doesn t mean that they can t shower themselves  so all they need is help getting situated safely in the shower and you leave them to it until you do the hard to reach bit over time  the patient regains their independence and goes home but if they are treated like they can t do anything they will believe it and they take much longer to recover   it s often really hard and confusing for carers to step back and not feel like you re abandoning your person but i encourage you to reflect and discern where your support is delaying or obstructing his progress and transition gradually to where you are metaphorically standing by ready to catch them if they fall but allowing them to do as much as they can  which is generally a lot more than they think    please really take this on board  because i guarantee that while you feel capable of carrying him  it will eventually be too much and you ll crash  and if he s still in his hole  you won t have the support you need then 
i ve been on both sides of this    there s a point where  if you re depressed and someone is doing the necessary things  you don t bother trying  because why would you    i really hate to say it   you re enabling him to avoid doing what he needs to do to get better    i m not saying break up with him   i m saying stop enabling him  it isn t on you to carry him out of the well of depression   it s on you to shine a light so he can see where to climb  but you can t shine the light  because you re trying to carry him  which is taking everything because you re already engaged in your climb    stop doing the basics   don t tell him to bathe  at least  for a long as you can stand it  if he s doing nothing  that can be weeks  don t make him food  or  not more often than once a day  and dear gods stop making it all from scratch  don t pick up after him  don t buy him things he hasn t asked for  even if he needs it  except prescriptions    hopefully this will be a big enough shock  but right now  he s barely hanging on  and doesn t want to do   but what he needs  is to start living   picking up his own mess is a reminder of life  i know it sounds weird  but  it s a reminder he can  he should   he s alive enough to make a mess  ergo  he s alive   and needs to start living again    but  you can t save him   only he can save himself  it s hard  it hurts  for both of you  standing and watching my partner while he was like this was one of the hardest things i ve ever done   but after   months  it was all i could do to try and get him  back   it took time  there were setbacks  and i had to be reminded more than once to not judge his progress by my own  if nothing else  different hormones and life experience between afab and amab people  and different trauma    i really hope this helps  and i send goodthoughts tm  to you both  ps  the carer also needs care  i m a random internet stranger  but then again i ve no bias  if you need to talk  and i have been you  the you needing the therapy for c ptsd  the you now trying to save your partner from his own pain  if you need that neutral ear  message me  might take a few days for me to respond  but i will
at this point  you are enabling him  not helping him  he sees no point in taking initiative and getting better while you are carrying his whole load  he needs to get help  and he needs to get back on his feet   and he won t do that while you are spoon feeding him and wiping his arse for him 
i don t think you know what the word love means   you need to love yourself to be capable of loving someone else    i d be all for sticking with him and helping if he was even trying but he isn t   you can t help someone who doesn t want to fix the problem   sticking around is just enabling and hurting him more in the long run 
i don t think you should break up with him    however  i do think you need to have an honest conversation with him and tell him that it s time for him to get help beyond you  at the very least therapy  don t be afraid to be blunt with him  and if he refuses  make him go anyway  if you are giving him all of this endless support for love  then you can be tough on him for love too  he sounds like he may need an extra push given that it s been so long 
i m afraid you are his last safety net before he needs to get back in the drivers seat of his own life and i worry that nothing you can say will change him  as i see it you have three options     stop doing everything you do and let him descend in to the squalor of missing your effort and having to put it in himself  warn him first you will be doing this specifically because he is making no effort to help himself and you do more than you can carry alone     break up with him  show him you won t stand for being the rock indefinitely  it s not the life you signed up for  try to move on  maybe consider dating again if he sorts his shit out     just try and be as honest and direct as you can about what you need and how badly he needs to change and start making effort for himself again  knowing that if he doesn t you re going to have to keep being harder and harder on him until one of you gives  which could result in you doing all the work for the foreseeable future   good luck op  don t let you desire to support him drag you down too 
if  love is blind  was a person it would have been op  even though i shamelessly went to my toxic ex   times i wasn t this much hopeless   honey  you re wasting your time   can you really imagine yourself living with him for the rest of your life    even though you can   you posted it here so imma still give my two cent opinion  loving someone shouldn t be this hard you know   you re just enabling him   but still your life   i mean on the bright side you re saving a lot of girls from him so i guess you re doing great  nahh keep him  all the best 
i am with you op  there are people who can barely stay loyal in a marriage  and here you both are literally loving and supporting each other  in sickness and in health  there s only one thing that i can say to help you   this shall too pass   on the other hand  i do understand that you re not here for advice or to understand whether you should continue the relationship  you re here because of the burn out  you re here to know how to cope yet help your boyfriend  and you re here to know if there s something else more you can do to help him  for that i would say get help from family for your household stuff and pets  while yours and your boyfriend s health and hygiene can become your priority  and for his health  maybe you can try homeopathy ayurvedic treatment  or reiki and meditation  i am not a strong believer of it but i have seen it work for people  you can pm me and i can get a reiki group to help you for free  i would need his name and picture  and last  you both seem like lovely people and great partners to each other  i can only imagine the effort you re putting in  to come out of this  hats off to you and your live for him    sending my prayers and love 
understandable  u are a good example of for sickness and health  but i also understand the other side  if ur willing  continue on what ur doing  beware it might take a toll  and even resentment  maybe he will get better  hope that he does  in the end  we are just rolling the dice  nah
your life decisions are completely yours to make  these people that tell you what to do  they don t have to live with the aftermath and the consequences of their recommendations  the choice is yours ultimately  it sounds like you love the guy and that he is worth the efforts to you 
you are incredibly strong and brave person to stand by him during this time  hrs lucky to have you    but he kept let you keep doing this forever  yea  trauma and grief and depression can become all consuming and debilitating  but he needs to work through this and move on  yea it s not easy and it takes time  but please don t let yourself become trapped by this    i m living with debilitating depression myself  currently single  one of my biggest fears is becoming a burden to the people around me    you re right to stand by him and help take care of him but he can take care of himself  but you also need to encourage him to learn how to take care of himself again 
you can t save him  you can t fix him  in fact  in trying to do either of those things you re going to end up hurting yourself    his situation is sad  but he s an adult and needs to either step up and find the will to just start  or fail and live in misery    you are waaaay too young to be a care taker for an able adult  everyone is right  you need to leave him and take care of yourself  if he manages to pull himself together someday and you re still single and willing to try again  if he comes back  then you can reconsider  but now it s time to let him sink or swim and you go live your life without him weighing you down 
you say it yourself  he is unwilling to work on helping yourself       you re going to run yourself to the ground for this guy  and never  ever have support from him       if this is the life you want  go for it 
the problem i see  and that you mentioned  is that he s unwilling to help himself  it sounds to me that maybe he s gotten or is getting used to you doing everything  if you re just going to do everything for him  what incentive would he have to get better  however  at the end of the day  it s up to you how you want to handle things going forward  do you want this to be your relationship dynamic for the rest of your lives  do you think that at some point one day  you re going to burn out from doing everything and resent him  if you want that are willing to deal with that  then that s fine  i know for myself  if my partner was not putting in any effort to get better  i would walk away  relationships are partnerships  two people working together to make things work  not one person giving         and the other doing nothing or next to nothing  i m not saying you shouldn t support your partner when they can t put in their fair share of the work  people have ups and downs and there are always going to be times when one partner has to pick up the slack for the other  i just worry for you that he ll get used to this and take advantage of you 
at this point you are enabling him  not helping him    you should be discussing the difference in your therapy and getting help to distinguish between the two   he needs to be evaluated  and getting appropriate treatment maybe even in patient   neither of you deserve to live like this  but he has to make an effort 
sounds like your boyfriend needs to work on himself  some people can t be  saved  by you  move on 
definitely don t leave just because of peer pressure  but also definitely make sure you haven t accidentally slipped into a place where he feels safe and enabled to continue this behavior because you re allowing it    i m not sure why everyone here is so desperate for you to drop him and move on  doing essentially all of the emotional physical labor in the relationship is obviously not great  but you love this dude and he s been through something incredibly traumatic    do you guys still have fun moments  or is he miserable all day not even trying to engage with you
stronger than anyone just by waking up  bc his pain must be so much worse than anyone else on the planet  almost everyone loses a parent at some point in life  millions of people find ways to function despite their depression every day  your bf isn t special and you re naive af if you think hes not just seeing how long he can get away with you being his caregiver 
honey  they aren t telling you to walk away because they don t understand love or because they doubt that you love him  they re begging you to love  yourself  enough to realise that your relationship dynamic has become unhealthy  that you re incredibly over invested in a relationship that was pushed to become too serious too fast because of shared trauma bonding  you re acting like you re this man s wife  his full time carer   responsible for him when that s not actually the relationship you have   if even his family think you need to walk away  you really should at least talk this through with a therapist  if it s really true love  it will survive you at least stepping back a tiny bit   allowing him to take more of a lead on managing his own recovery with their help 
i may be wrong  but feels like what gives you strength is more the idea you have of true love than love itself  feels like you need to prove your love to yourself  him or the others and that s why you re doing it for the most part    maybe there s some love that still linger in your heart for him  but that can t last forever if he doesn t reciprocate  you have your emotional needs too right   if he can at least show his love to you and you re satisfied with the situation  then it s all good i guess
key word is we and us do you feel like there is an us right now  what does he do to help you  how does he make your life easier not harder 
if everyone is giving you the same advice  consider that you may be looking at things from a bad perspective  and they may be right 
what other people say  you are enabling him  you are part of his problem  i am sorry   that doesn t mean you should break up  but something needs to change  the alternative could be that everything collapses just at the moment that you have no energy and power  left to deal with that   furthermore  you should ask yourself if you would love him so much if you would have solved your own issues and are more confident and demanding as a result of that   take good care of yourself   i have a strong feeling that you will overcome all ypur troubles and will find peace and hapiness     lots of luck 
i was once in a relationship where we both had undiagnosed and untreated depression  we were over as a couple long before i got help for myself  but he didn t do the same for himself  he came back into my life in a weird way and i immediately could feel him dragging me back under  so i cut him out of my life permanently for my own wellbeing   when i asked my therapist if i had done the right thing  she said i have to ask myself that question  not her  for me  cutting him out of my life was absolutely the right thing to do   do not dismiss the concerns of your family and his entirely  you will know better than anyone that a person who doesn t want to helped cannot be helped  but you re also invested more deeply than even his family and that can warp your perspective  so  your biggest responsibility is actually to look after your mental health first  you cannot be there for him in the long run if you are not first there for yourself  it is far easier for the unwilling party to drag down their partner than it is for the partner to pull them out  depression is quicksand  it ll pull you down before you can pull him out if either of you are dealing with it in the wrong way    he is definitely dealing with it in the wrong way  are you   you must monitor yourself in a completely honest way  are you are dragging yourself down  are you enabling him by being a gilded cage in which he can hide from himself and the world without having to face himself  you must consider whether you are doing the right thing for either of you   if you re not sure you can be fully honest with yourself  you should consider returning to therapy to give you a professional sounding board to help you monitor yourself and your actions in an honest way 
so  i m going against the grain and saying that love takes courage  it takes courage to stick around through the bad    i ve been with my husband for almost    years and we ve been married almost    years  we ve been through a lot together  he stuck with me when all of a sudden i put on    pounds for no known reason  took   doctors about a year to figure out what happened     we got married  had our first kitty  who was our child  pass away unexpectedly       happened  his dad passed  then just a few months later  his stepfather passed  our first year of marriage was incredibly hard  i went into a deep depression when his step dad died because i was close to him  he was the dad i didn t have   i barely got out of bed  he had to take care of our other kitty  our home  himself  and me  we stuck together  we made it through everything  i also refused counseling  but with my husband s love and encouragement  i went and it helped    we ve been through a lot more throughout the years  my mother got divorced from her  th husband  i had a couple of major surgeries  so did he  my mother eventually got married to a new husband  they were both major alcoholics  my mother got cancer  new step dad ended up with heart failure  we had more deaths in our family  my step dad passed  my mother moved  covid happened  husband s grandmother died just before covid  both of my grandmother s died during covid times  my mother passed  husband had major surgeries    we ve had a lot of tough times but we ve also had a lot of good times  sometimes i give     and he gives      sometimes he gives     and i m only giving      but we make it through    if you think that you can survive the storm  then keep fighting for your boyfriend and your relationship  if you don t think you can continue  that s okay too  no one can make the decision but you    blessed be 
it s not his fault that he s depressed  but being unwilling to go to therapy would be a deal breaker for me   have you directly asked him to go to therapy 
there s so much wrong with this    you cannot help a person who won t help themselves  you ve literally tried and failed with the therapy  you don t seem to realize that life isn t black and white  and you can leave him while still being there to support him    i m curious if when you went through your depressive episode was he cooking  cleaning everything  did he do your laundry for you  did he make therapy appointments and try to force you to get better   he s absolutely in there  but it s clear as day he doesn t plan on coming out  you will run yourself to the bone thinking that sacrificing everything for love is healthy    i mean  what does  your  therapist have to say about all this   eta if you were stuck taking care of a narcissist then i can totally see why you think this is normal  but please compare your current situation to the one with your mother 
sometimes  love isn t enough
you know why airlines have you put your oxygen mask on first  because you can t help anyone if you can t breathe  you have to take care of yourself somewhere in here because there is a breaking point where you will be suffocating  this is not sustainable 
do you think because he was there for you and your depression  you d feel guilty if you didn t continue doing everything op 
why would he get better if he has you taking care of him like this 
foolish  reckless and naive to set sacrifice yourself for someone who refuses to get help  you are harming yourself for a man who refuses to get help  at some point your own health will suffer because of this relationship 
i m   f  my man is   m  we have a  mo son  we ve been together since january of      and living together since september of       we both struggle with depression and anxiety  combined with self destructive behavior on my part and substance abuse on my partner s side  we ve been through a lot together  including the passing of my man s father also and moving over a thousand miles away from family and back because of our baby boy  we re technically only girlfriend and boyfriend but we call each other  fianc  fianc e  to people that don t know us  we both have rings on our fingers that we wear every day without a second thought  point being  we re basically married  if only common law marriage was still around    one thing i have learned is that unless i absolutely love and care for myself first  i can not love and care for others   not properly  imagine trying to save someone from drowning but you don t even know how to swim  it does not work  soon enough you will both be drowning    i have told my partner time and time again  even as we are now parents together   you can not stay with me if i am dragging you down  if i am abusive  if i get to be too much  whatever it is  put yourself first so that our son and i get the best of you  we all deserve that  
i hear you  and i understand what you re going through  but be careful  you might not be his helper at this point  you might be his enabler    please male a deadline for yourself  if he does not get better  if he does not even start to work on himself and get outside help  when the time is up  you need to leave    the deadline could be   months from now  or one year if you want to be generous  but don t stay   years in this  or more   the thing is  if you are the enabler  then you are screwing his life while thinking you help him  as long as you do everything for him  he doesn t need to get up and do anything    he can stay in this depressive state for years if he doesn t get help  and you re making it very easy for him to continue like this    i know you feel like you owe him from the past  but you also owe him to get his but moving  so think about what you re doing and why  and if it s really helping 
does he know that you re running yourself into the ground and still refuses therapy  if so then how loving is he really 
if feel like if you truly loved him  you would stop enabling him and make it a condition of you staying with him that he gets therapy 
i m not saying you should leave him  but you should   slowly  stop doing everything for him    keep reminding him about getting help  but stop reminding him about brushing his teeth     you have   pets  do any need walks  ask him as a favor to do so  it might help    stop checking for things that only he uses that are running low  wait until he notices    i do not have any experience with depression   but one thing i know is that you can t help anyone who doesn t want to be helped     stay with him  if you really think that s what you need to do  but be careful not to burn the candle on both ends  with your history on depression  who is going to help you and your precious pets if both of you are unable to do anything 
i don t believe in so called sacrifices and unconditional love  it s no longer sacrificed when it s exceeded your ability  and the unconditional love is especially just plain stupid  and it applies to everyone  husband  kids  parents  siblings  friends    i ll be there throughout your darkest time  your lowest point  but you gotta do what you got to do   i m not going to be everyone s caregiver for life just like that without any plans for the future or even more  being a lifetime caregiver unnecessarily 
your devotion is a beautiful thing to behold  but if he s not willing to stand up and start walking through life with you  and take care of you as much as you take care of him  work as hard as you work  etc    you can t accept that for yourself  it s not your job to fix him  you will become so unhappy catering to his misery for the rest of your life  he needs to wake the fuck up 
you risk making it too comfortable for him to get out of his own way 
i don t think you need to break up with him right away  but you may need to start putting in a timeline for him to get treated  if you give him an ultimatum  you need to follow through on it  you leaving may be the bottom that needs to fall out for him to start getting better  right now  he s extremely comfortable 
i don t care what the others think  i think you re amazing and your loyalty is inspiring  hang in there  i m sure you re trying to get him to take his meds  just be patient and persistent  stay the course  i have faith in both of you 
you re lighting yourself on fire for someone you care about but they aren t even looking for wood while you give them your warmth     your fire won t last forever     your own history makes you want to help someone you care for get better  like you did   but sometimes   being a helping hand enables them to not have to do all the work themselves   i wouldn t say leave him   but you gotta take a break    i wish y all luck   and all the best   seems like the love is truly strong here 
yea i d continue supporting him  communicate on why he stays in one place  maybe recognition of his mortality hit him that bad  will take a lot of work to move past that  you are obviously a great pair and support each other through thick and thin  i admire both of your devotions 
i think op s bf has the  what s the point of any effort into   anything    because i m just going to die like my dad did  only earlier   mentality going on  so he has no motivation to help himself  if there was only a way for op to convince to help himself  he obviously knows the steps because he helped op in the right direction  now he has to do it for himself who never was depressed before  that we know  and can t see the forest for the trees  he seems like such a good guy too  maybe op he can read a couple of self help books or videos on yt 
desperately hanging on to something to prove everyone wrong no matter how much it hurts you  interesting strategy  cotton  let s see how it works out 
the way i see it you just need to be there for him  you re doing the right things  he just needs to shake this off  if he s in therapy and taking meds something will click and make him snap out of it  take care of your man and ignore the peanut gallery 
love is love  hold his face in your warm hands  look right in his eyes  and tell him that you need him back  this is what woke me up  i do know where your head is  you are an angel 
i know you don t want advice  but i m going to give it anyway because i hope to hell this helps you and your boyfriend     take your boyfriend out of his comfort zone   go on a trip   a lazy weekend trip with at least two hours of driving to get there   stay at a b b where you re not going to get a safe  corporate grey color scheme   even if the frills on the curtains make you guys wonder what the heck the innkeeper was thinking  it will be worth it   go to a museum or two  go for a tour of something  go out for dinner and lunch   get out of your routines   this will be the first step of many   he has to get outside of himself to find his way through this 
honestly  i agree with you  i genuinely feel like people have forgotten what real  true love looks like  it s self sacrificing  even detrimental  sometimes borderline obsessive and can often be unhealthy    but how many ways can we explain that they just don t see what we see  for them it s just a set of circumstances  but for us we can see the person underneath it all  and we know that the person beneath all the layers of hurt and depression is so much more wonderful than anyone can really comprehend  that is what keeps us around and it s so easy for people to judge from the outside  give advice where none is wanted or needed  sometimes we hang onto things that are broken because sacrifice means giving up something good for something even better later on  especially since we have been there and know where others failed us    my husband is the same  he has problems that  right now  he s not willing to address  but ffs that s my husband  in sickness and in health  that was the deal  and i hate it when people tell me idk what i m doing  i m an adult  stop questioning my choices for my life  i love him  isn t that good enough  i m willing to stay and sacrifice my happiness  that used to be honorable  what happened  no wonder our society is lonelier than ever  no one wants to deal with the discomfort and  unfairness  of having to be the carrier of the weight sometimes    op  your boyfriend is lucky to have you  and you re lucky to have had him when you needed him  and you re wonderful for continuing to support him even when the whole world is telling you to give up on him  we will not give up  because they didn t give up on us  that s a measure of character  not a flaw  that s love  period 
yall are just straight up assholes  she took   years to improve  but god forbid the man takes a couple to improve    he did everything he could for her while suffering himself  if this post was from him a year ago for his gf  yall would be saying drop the gf    truth is  the commenters here are just straight up materialistic assholes  i hope you get all yhe love in the world op  and dont listen to the salty commenters who are just jealous they dont have someone this caring in their lives    i feel bad you have to read through all these heartless assholes  comments 
my partner stayed with me  it lasted longer than in should have  he couldn t help me and i couldn t help myself  scarry af    when he had a low moment  i could help him because i had been there      i appreciate that he stayed and i appreciate him  we are now thriving and stronger and better partners for it    only you know if you can stay  sounds like he s been there for you for a very long time  he needs you now 
he can t even brush his own teeth        is he an adult 
you don t sound like you re personally in distress about your relationship  you re being told you should be  don t worry about what others think  you know this guy  trust yourself 
i am sorry that you are in this situation dear   it s not easy  kudos to you for being so strong and for giving that unconditional love   let me ask you tho  are you here because you want someone to validate your stand  or are you here hoping that someone would make a strong point to negate your reasons   ask yourself that and it ll simply answer which path you would want to take    regardless of your decision  i hope that you ll not forget to love yourself too  the way  or even more  that you have been loving your partner 
you can t fix him
i feel this is your life and as long as you re not being abused and your therapist is checking on you  this is on you  but yes he s doing nothing for himself and this isn t right for him and for you  i would consider  always asking to the professional first  if pushing him in some different way may be useful
honey  i say this with compassion  you do not know what love is  your boyfriend is using you and dragging you down  you need to end the relationship and allow him the space to figure out his life because right now he is on cruise control while you basically take care of him  he needs the motivation to pick himself up and you aren t it  your actions are holding both of you back  as someone who is truly in love with their spouse     love is not the codependent mess you are in     you are enabling his incredibly poor behavior  everyone who acts like him has trauma  that is no excuse to act the way he is acting     someone who truly loves you will help lift you up when you need it and carry their own weight  he is doing neither of those things for you     love is not enough  you can love someone  that doesn t mean it will be a successful happy relationship    he isn t the one  maybe he will be one day but he needs to be alone to dig himself out and pick himself up if he ever decides to do that 
nobody can be inconvenienced anymore  no one wants to fight for anything  is it going to be hard on you in that situation  yes  but if you feel it is what is right even though it s hard  you do it 
i get your feeling  you were on his shoes and knows how it hurts when people leave when on you on your worst  also love is not just a feeling  it s a feeling   a construction around it  moreover  both of you haven t their brain fully developed or just developed so the centering of feelings is a bit different     so see it maybe this way  you both have an unconditional love feeling but the whole responsibility of the relationship is on you  it won t functions or work at this point of the relationship if you don t put your effort to keep that whole relationship together and that s not okay and it s why people will tell you to leave him   however they forget what cptsd is also possibly your boyfriend grew up in a dysfunctional family so both or you have a fear to be abandoned and are co dependant what usually is in feeling a stronger feeling of love as an healthy loving relationship    i won t tell you to leave  these kind of relationship can work but it asks for both of you knowing their own flaws and put boundaries around it and it asks therapy on both side  so you are doing it but he s not and you need to accept that you can t help him and that he has to go to therapy because he s own flaw isn t your responsibility    so you should both discuss how you see the future and what is he willing to do to make the relationship work  so that the responsibility of the relationship falls on both of you in a seemly fair way because at this moment it s not and you will burn out from this  savior complex    i was partly on your place too 
he isn t willing to do anything  you are not helping him  you are enabling him  there is no  we  will overcome this  he isn t interested in overcoming it   walk away 
sounds like he s dealing with major depression  he should be on medication asap  if he is too depressed to take it himself  you could maybe put some in his juice if he is ok doing it that way 
i read a previous post  about how from a young age you had to take care of your mother and sister  the experiences of our youth impact our present and i m worried you think caretaking and acts of service are mandatory in love  at the end of the day  who in your life is taking care of you 
your commitment and dedication to him is so amazing and shows how much you love him  that said  it gets to a point where you start to enable him to take advantage of the situation  resentment will build if he continues to refuse to help himself  and you deserve more than what you re getting  good luck 
what would he do if something happened to you  would he be able to take care of himself    god forbid  say you bust an ankle or something  would he be able to help you then 
it sounds like you re doing it less because you love him so much and more bc you like having a project  you acknowledge he isn t doing anything to help himself  so you just like doing it for him
you re way too young to be in this kind of situation  all i can read in your post sounds like you re trying to convince yourself this is right and you know deep down is not   sacrifices should be from both of you  not just you  and you need to comprehen this some people don t want to be saved 
i get your all for love viewpoint  although  you do hopefully realize that doing all the work load for two  you will eventually hit burn out  and  what s his motivation if you are  so happy  to do it all anyway  maybe he needs to contribute to the household to feel useful 
everyone is right  you are probably treating him how you d want to be treated if the shoe was on the other foot  his family is telling you if it were  he wouldn t treat you the same  what you are doing isn t love  it s more likely to be a manifestation of whatever mental and social issues you have    it s one thing if you were married for    years and he hit a rough patch  this is a young man you aren t married to  who is struggling so much he can t reciprocate  there is only you pouring all of your energy into someone who can t give it back and may never  there is no  we  in this    if you love him give him space to heal  let him choose to be with you when he is in a healthy mental state    if you love yourself  talk to a professional about your own mental health  and why you feel the need to hold on to this boyfriend 
this is for both of you   we owe it to ourselves and to each other to work on our own shit  and also to not feel like shit   encourage each other to complete at least two things on the  daily list    daily list   basic hygiene incl  brush teeth  wash face  wash hair in sink if possible  food   water  address at least one annoying thing  e g  flickering lightbulb  dirty plate on bed table  etc    fun    minutes min   you both will feel better  and you deserve to  good luck 
i was your bf  i almost died when i was     and ended up with permanent lung damage and severe depression  my bf was amazing  and really helped me when i needed it  except for the part where i got used to doing nothing  so i did  i was afraid to leave the house or do pretty much anything  the best thing he ever did was take a job where he had to be gone for weeks at a time  just taking the garbage out was a huge accomplishment at first  but it felt really good to not be a sad lump all the time  i got on meds and started therapy and tried to start being a person again   your bf does not want to get better  so he will not  by now he should be on meds and in therapy  he should be trying  that doesn t mean he should instantly be better  but he has to actually try  you are a good person  but you cannot do this without his help  honestly  sometimes the best thing we can do for a person is to stop helping  your bf has no reason to get better since he has you doing everything for him 
i can empathise  you love him to pieces and you re doing absolutely everything to look after the love of your life  you re doing a lot of juggling of looking after your partner but also looking after your own wellbeing  there will come a time when you may become completely burnt out with it all   i did the same for an ex partner for    years  someone who wouldn t seek help  someone who felt they didn t need help and i helped them and picked up the pieces but inevitably i got burnt out and i ended up resenting him and ended the relationship  would an intervention work  i don t think these people in your life don t love their partners  they re just looking out for you  take care of you 
i was in the same state as your bf  i spent years barley able to function because of my depression  i had no desire to do anything to get better or even to help myself  the worst thing was that everyone enabled me to the point i had no reason to put in any effort to even try  it nearly destroyed my family by looking after me and it wasn t until was forced into the hospital for a week that i actually started to try to get better  right now you are doing whst you think is best  but really are doing the worst thing for him 
how long do you wait for things to get better  it sucks but sometimes love just isn t enough 
you are his gf not his psychiatrist
he s a sink with an open drain  there will never be enough to carry someone who has no vested interest in saving themselves  i think it s fair to give him some concrete actions like going to a therapy consult or whatever it is that will help  as a bare minimum  he has to be willing to get help 
yeahhhh i felt the same and now i m living with my mom with our three kids  if they don t want to change or get better they won t 
the problem isn t that he is depressed  the problem is that he won t do anything to fix it  people like this will suck the life out of you if you let them 
at what point does help turn into enabling   you sound truly compassionate  empathetic  committed  loyal and an absolute gem   i understand depression too   but i genuinely wonder how long is too long   when does help turn into a new comfort zone for the one receiving it   i dont know the answer to this  but i think it is something to maybe think about 
you can t fix someone who doesn t want to be fixed  all you re doing now is enabling him  if you re in therapy  please talk to your therapist on what the best thing to do is for your health 
it s almost cute how much youthful na vet  is in this post     i don t believe that there is too much sacrifice for love  i think you missed the part where you re supposed to love yourself too  but maybe you were too busy getting off on being a martyr  that s fun and exciting when you re    with lots of energy and few life responsibilities  not so much fun after years and years and years of giving so much to someone who s giving you nothing in return  you care so much about your boyfriend  but who s paying attention to how much you re sacrificing for this dead end relationship  clearly he doesn t give a crap 
you need to help yourself  not him  you need to learn boundaries and when  helping  is too much  it s not your fault you did not learn that as a child  alanon groups helped me learn that stuff  a good therapist can also help you  you can go to alanon even if he s not an alcoholic  when you drive your bf to a tberapist you made the appt for that he refuses to see that is like someone covering for and cleaning up after their drunk partner  you seem to not understand what  enabling  is and that is ok  once you learn about it and apply your new non enabling skills your life will get better 
y all are codependent  he needs meds and therapy  non negotiable  put your foot down before you both drown
your family is right  
i have ptsd and have been down the rabbit hole since       i started to climb back out in        it s not that i didn t want to help myself or my spouse didn t want to help me but i couldn t see up   i ever saw was dark no matter what time of day it was   i didn t take care of my self at all  i closed myself off from everything and everyone  i barely talked to my wife for two to three years   your partner needs medication and a lot of therapy and people that are willing to understand what he s going through   sometimes depression can dig you a hole so deep you don t know which way is up  you can reach out for help and touch nothing because you think your reaching you know your reaching but in reality you re just sitting there inside your head   for seven years i only left my house to outside to smoke i wanted nothing to do with anybody or the outside world   your guy has a long road to travel and he s going to need a lot of support and encouragement from all sides 
i chose to stay in a similar situation but i had children   things that helped him get out of the slump were me arranging therapy and going with him until he was comfortable going on his own  in some cases  i would do all the talking and simply refer to him for confirmation that what i was an accurate reflection of his feelings  i also arranged for us to go on walks together every evening  we would walk in silence sometimes but others he d chat away as he felt more comfortable not looking at me  this would sometimes give me insight for the next therapy session   the other thing i did was set one small task each day  it might be washing my car  unstuck the dishwasher  hand clothes out  just having one thing to focus on meant he wasn t overwhelmed and made him feel like he was contributing  he didn t have the capacity to think for himself or make decisions so i did it for him   my husband hasn t improved in fact he most likely has neurological issues which affect his mood and cognitive ability    it s not easy  but only you know your strength and what you can tolerate  just make sure you take care of yourself too  plan days where you just focus on you  you need to recharge your battery especially if you have your own issues 
you re a good person  remind him as often as you can that he has to meet you at least halfway  get him into therapy  take him to the doctor  make sure he gets the help he needs to help himself  but always remind him at every step that if he isn t laying down some throttle of his own then auxiliary thrusters can t do much 
i think you are in denial   
you can t help someone who doesn t want to be helped   the point is he has no drive to do so  and it s dragging you down with him 
so  you also have depression and are still doing everything  why is it expected of you but not him  he is responsible for his mental health  it s great that you love and want to help him  but you can t sacrifice everything for him  there has to be a point where he helps himself and starts to contribute  or else you burn out 
my husband doesn t understand that i don t want him to save me but to help me  be supportive  i ve always saved myself  i had no choice really  i got therapy and started to dig myself out    i don t think an ultimatum will work but a deep talk where you express yourself and what you need and getting to know what he needs  but he cam only really help himself  you don t need to drown 
so what happens if he never gets better  are you going to be his maid forever  you can stubbornly think that loving someone means you have to suffer for years  but that s not true  why is it fair that you have done so much for your mental health but he won t  why is that acceptable to you 
it may be time to temporarily step away  sometimes people need a push to get out of that depressive hole  you re making it too comfortable for him  why would he improve when he is taken care of in every aspect of his life  make him a little uncomfortable  it s ok  you are enabling at this point    ask him what the point of living through a near death experience if he s not willing to live his life 
if my family or friends ever said that  i would seriously consider it   they have a more objective view and would never interfere unless it they felt it was critical   however some families just like to control the situation and people  they should not be involved  should you listen  as always  it depends on the source   consider their points but it s your life 
you re throwing your youth away  better focus on yourself 
i did everything you re doing for my husband  he s better now and walked out on me like i was a piece of trash now that he doesn t need me anymore  i wasted    years of my life  and ruined my physical and mental health  thinking he would do better by me when he was better  and i m the only one who is treated like vermin now  despite being the only one who was there for him and didn t run and hide like little babies  his family and friends   now those jerks  who did absolutely nothing to help either of us and stood by and watched me suffer  get to reap the benefits of my suffering  please don t make the mistake i did  walk away before it s too late 
oh sweetie  he will never get better if you keep doing things for him  why should he  maybe consider backing up a bit  not leaving  forever just something to light a fire under his ass and get him wanting to get better  if he doesn t want to he won t  no matter how much you do for him  he has to want it and he doesn t right now or maybe ever  maybe if he feels he might lose you he ll at least make an effort to get better  he never will if you keep allowing him to wallow in his depression  good luck 
he doesn t know how to help himself 
i think you should live in a way that aligns with your principles and what you believe  if you are okay with misery and suffering in the name of love  who am i or anyone else  to tell you otherwise 
perhaps he needs to see a grief counselor  or maybe an intensive outpatient 
at this point  it doesn t sound like supporting anymore  it sounds like enabling  if you continue to do all of this for him then he will stay right where he s at  i agree that you need to walk away  not forever  but give him enough space to have to want to get better  he is going nowhere with you doing literally everything for him  there is a huge difference between you supporting him and him just plain taking advantage of the situation and using his conditions and trauma to excuse it 
ok so i haven t read the comments on purpose  i just came to say it seems like you re taking great care of him and yourself and you know the situation and what s going on  i say this because i ve got similar diagnoses  and since a breakdown  loooooong story leading up to  as these things go lol  i ve been doing the work i need and asking for help  i started that before i met my current bf  and he has his own stuff  particularly addiction so we have similar ways of approaching things  so it can be cyclical with us too  and he s the first partner i ve ever had who i communicate and connect on the same level as  long story short  he supports me through the hard stuff  particularly grief and the trauma work i m doing  and i supported support him with getting  and staying  i trust    i hope  sober  and before then  he needed medical detox  he knew and i told him  that i know it s a journey he needs to start and do by himself  and that i will support him through it  however there may be a point if he doesn t get sober that i reach my limit    so with that in mind  and with the intention of support and helping  i m good with if it s not relevant and or not needed  i wanted to say that you are doing the right stuff  dealing with it in the way you need to to stay healthy  the people seeing it from the outside have your welfare in mind  which is also great  as long as it doesn t cross any lines  and you know that he needs to ask for help  he needs to start the process  and if you need to gently remind him that s up to you entirely  and if you reach your limit  that s again entirely your decision and for you to get to with the support you have set up around you    and something that to me seems simple now  but i didn t know what i didn t know until i did   sometimes we grow together and sometimes we grow apart and either one is ok    oh and it s also ok to not know  that one was hard for me too lol   i wish you the best op
op  you can be right about what love means   about it being worthy of sacrifice   and still be wrong about what your bf needs that love to look like rn  what does your therapist say 
it sounds like he needs specialized  grief counseling   not just any random anti depression therapy     
you can t make someone start caring about their life by loving them into it  sometimes you have to be the one to step back so they can truly understand what they are losing out on in life
hey  i m different i have a success story for you girl   my soulbond was laid up real bad with depression  it was alot of work  but he s working full time  changed diet  sober  not suicidal  investing  saving  spending time with our son             things now   has his own therapist  fuck  i knew he was  in there    had the potential for greatness   if he d only listen     my advise  tell him that his life is more important to you than it might be to him right now  tell him you ardent leaving  tell him he deserves you re love   you ll love him until he loves himself again     i m borderline  bipolar   adhd   ect   on meds   therapy weekly with group   classes   i tell him everything i learn  at first he was against all of it  now   mood stabilizer and testosterone     had your man had doctor visit anytime recently  i might thunk what medically can we rule out  thyroid can cause mood problems  low testosterone is awfully depressing and awful for men     does he have a best friend  reach out  invite him over  remind him that the world is still spinning  and people support him no matter what  be beef    if he becomes abusive   i think you know what to do     but as for the fam   friends     sounds like it time they stfu  set a boundary that you d like them to keep their opinions to themself about your man  tell them that it s innapropriate how they ve spoken to you and you feel let down by them  inform them if they cross the boundary you will end the confederation on your end  walking away  hanging up  um    idk but you ve heard their words  they will be jarred that you re seeing a boundary prob  be prepared for  but i only said that to look put for you  instead of  ok  i understand   realize they ardent getting what they wanted  so they will not be happy   first  i hope you don t get any  you ll see s out of anyone  tell them you appreciate them caring but   this point  it s off the table  it s your decision     now  if you choose to do this     realize you can t talk about him anymore to everyone unfortunatly  that will make thhem think it s their busibess again     keep yourself validated in a journal   congratulate yourself for making a big decision  to be an adult  not care what others want for your life  you got this 
there is supporting and then there is enabling him  you need to give him a deadline to get to a doctor and start therapy tell him you are willing to drive him until the meds start to kick in  if you don t give him a swift kick in the pants he is not going to get better  depression can be like that where you can t find the energy to get help but you can t also let him stew in it  you cannot set yourself on fire to keep others warm that will destroy you
you know  there is a fine line between helping and enabling    at some point you are going to run out of options both for yourself and him  when you are burnt out  who will be there to pick up the pieces    you ve been proactive about your mental health which is excellent  he has to as well otherwise this is you life with him  what you have now is how it will be or worse if he doesn t attempt to help himself as well    what will it cost you in the long run  he has no incentive to do anything because you do everything    you ve paid him back  you don t owe him more than he is willing to give himself 
i can tell you that it s a good idea to listen to what the people who love you say about your significant other  that s not to say you should break up because they think that  but you need to weigh their opinions because they know and love you   when my now ex and i were dating  not one of my friends or family members thought it was a good idea  no one  they were very blunt with their  correct  as it happens  opinions  i loved him and was willing to overlook a whole lot of crap because i wanted so badly to be with him  he turned out to be an abusive asshole    he s also the father of my wonderful son who s the best thing that s ever happened to me  and he was a terrible father to our son  so in hindsight  i can t say i would take their advice  but only because i wouldn t have my son   he s the only good thing about that    year hellscape   but i would not go blindly into the relationship the way i did back then  and if i d been stronger going in  it might have been easier to get out 
not my business to tell you to leave or to stay  that s on you  please take some time each day to do something just for you though    minutes in the sun outside  eat a piece of chocolate and don t share  smile at a stranger  let your animals love you  i d his bucket is empty and you re refilling it  who is filling yours  these little things might just be drops  but even drops have some magic 
my husband committed suicide last year  after a long battle with depression and other mental health issues  i now know the battle was going on much more severely and much longer than i ever realized   he and i have both fought depression for a long time  the past few years were the worst  for both of us  frankly  in retrospect  it was only a matter of time before one or both of us lost that fight  neither of us was getting the help we needed outside of each other  e g  therapy  and as clich  as it sounds  you can t pour from an empty cup   i say this from a place of love  and from personal experience  if he s not getting the help he needs on his own  you need to reevaluate the relationship  i don t mean  you should walk away    at least not without doing everything within your reasonable ability to help him  to the extent that it doesn t break you in the process   i loved my husband with all my heart  he was my life  my heart  my soul  i would have done anything to keep him here  but he wouldn t let me in enough  or allow me to get him the help he needed  he wasn t reaching out for help from anyone else either  i was stuck in torment every day  it was terrifying and painful and exhausting  i suffered deeply and those scars will take a very long time to heal   if he isn t willing or open to getting help for himself  consider what that may mean for the relationship  for him  and for you   this is the worst kind of situation to be in  the person you love most is slipping away from you and it feels like this time  you may not be able to bring him back on your own  he needs help  he needs to be willing to receive help from someone who isn t you  from a mental health professional  you can t be his only support system  especially since you have your own struggles too   i m not saying he s not worth it  i m sure he is worth it to you  you re the only one who can make that call  but he may be beyond your ability to help him by yourself   i desperately hope he gets help  sending you love and support and good vibes 
stop enabling this person  separate  get back together after he manages x 
he needs to be inpatient in a hospital  my ex girlfriend was the same  i was essentially her carer for over a year and paid all our bills while she dealt with crippling depression   mild psychosis  i kept saying it was okay because we re in love  we have a lovely life ahead of us if we can just get through this tough spot  her cheating on me constantly and emotionally abusing me lol  couldn t see it at the time   then she started getting slightly better and dumped me lmao    normally i d say ultimatums aren t healthy but what he s asking of you now isn t fair and he isn t able to offer you a healthy relationship  i would say that unless he agrees to intensive treatment you re going to have to leave for your own wellbeing    ask his parents if they can help pay for inpatient treatment in a hospital  i think at least offering him the opportunity is a good idea  you want to give it a shot  his brain is actively sabotaging him and doesn t want him to get better right now so try not to take it personally if he choses not to   and i hope you re taking care of yourself and have outside support too  
my ex was also traumatized by a life or death experience  it made his behavior erratic  he would not go to therapy  some days it was all love and other days it was not  he depended on me heavily for everything  emotionally  financially  etc  he did not put effort into bettering our relationship    the things we experience do not justify our behavior towards others  they are a cause  not an excuse    i am very happy my ex and i broke up  and  though there it was a hard first year for him  i think he is a much better person now because of it  he got into therapy and secured a good job  he even started paying me back for the money i provided him during our relationship  don t expect that leaving him is going to ruin his life  if it does  that is his decision    do not stick around with something who puts no effort towards you  relationships should be eb and flow  not all eb 
i do think it is admirable that you care so deeply for him  however  he has to fend for himself  you can lead a horse to water  but you can t make  em drink  only you ve dragged the water to him and are holding his hand while he drinks  you need to express concern that he needs help  more than you can give  and if he can t  then you gotta listen to his family  tell him you miss when he would cook  that you know how much it helped you to get on meds and go to therapy  but seeing him struggle so much makes you wish he d do the same  i know you don t want advice  but this post seems more like a cry for help or at least trying to convince yourself that this is fine  don t get to a point where you resent him  eventually  you ll have to understand that if you love him  let him go  right now  you re doing yourself a disservice by being so adamant that you can do everything  yes  you could very well be right  and he could get back on his feet and prove everyone wrong  however  when his family is telling you to leave him  that is when you need to listen  they care about the both of you and can see he is dragging you down with him 
one day you ll realize you can t save someone who doesn t want to be saved  he is a literal sinking ship with no life vests on board  he s drowning and he s going to take you down with him 
hope he makes it out     godspeed 
info  have you talked about this situation with your therapist 
have you ever thought of listening to the people in your life  maybe they are on to something  idk  
so they are afraid you are enabling rather than supporting  is he taking medication for his depression  a supporter would ensure that is happening rather than not  imo  infantilizing someone by doing everything for them can be changed to waiting to see if action occurs and when it doesnt asking a multi choice question to spur action  for instance  are you getting a shower first or are you going to make coffee   to get him out of bed  doing this gives him positive actions to be involved in rather than passively following orders   i feel like this would be good for both of you and i wish you both well 
as long as you are comfortable living this way forever  keep on keepin  on     if you are doing all of this with the expectation that he will eventually bounce back  you might be in for some major frustration in the future   i am not giving advice to break up or leave him   just make sure your expectations are in line with what is currently happening      he loved and took care of me at my lowest and i am happy to do the same for him    and then make sure you get support to help you for when the burden of daily life gets to be too heavy  house keeper  pet sitter  grocery delivery  etc    
i admire the devotion  i wish you will get through this together  and remember  the stars shine the brightest in the dark
having problems with your own mental health i see how him and how much you love him is very important  breaking up against what you feel in your heart is something i feel could break you  and only you live in your head and your life  people have a tendency not to see their  help  as potentially harmful   his unwillingness can be that any decision paralyses him  because doing anything is a decision  two hard years and a brain that may have a small damage  the stress in losing his dad can have made that worse    try to see if he is willing to talk about how making decisions feels and try to get him to make small decisions by picking between two things that both work for you  it can be as small as picking the scent on the soap for the bathroom  red or yellow bell peppers with dinner  the fat   in the milk  making choices that aren t life or death    this is not based on him being your partner  just him being an important person you care about and my own experience  i hope this can help you both 
i hope things get better quickly  don t forget to take care of yourself too  he s lucky to have you and i m sure he appreciates you even though he s not in a place to show it rn
sounds like you both need therapy  you re enabling behaviour doesn t make you  strong  or enforce your love for him the way you think it does   which is sad because you obviously care very deeply for him 
the thing about mental health is that you can only fix yourself  no one else can do it  whether that s partners  family  therapists  they can help give you the tools to do it and give you comfort and a safety net  but the work has to come from yourself  he is not doing that  and you are enabling that 
if this is where you want to be  then be here     the difficulty is that your boyfriend needs something that will break his daily patterns in a major way  that doesn t have to be you leaving   you ve thrown in with what sounds like an incredible guy outside of this depression   but if he s deteriorating and not willing to take action  then unless he changes his perspective he will slide downward     that might happen on its own   or some external event might wake him up to how bad it is   or it might not  i don t know that leaving him would fix anything for him  i suspect not  but the drive to improve has to come from him 
you  think  with your heart  stop  the brain is the tool for this 
just make sure that you continue to better yourself as you help him  don t let him drag you down  you re doing what you feel is best  the only thing i am going to give advice on is this  i won t condemn you  because i have been there too  just make sure you don t let him drag you down  i ll be cheering you both on from the other side of the screen 
he needs professional help  not a mommy girlfriend taking care of everything for him so he doesn t have to even try to get better    your devotion is commendable  you don t have to walk away or give up but you should be trying to get him the help he needs to get better so he can actually participate in your relationship as a functional adult instead of leaving you stuck in a caretaker role  that s not fair to you 
if you refuse to walk away because of your own reasons  i suggest you make sure you are maintaining and not reducing your own therapy    also  please be sure to practice appropriate self care  personal time  personal hobbies  relaxation outside of your partner so you don t experience burnout    if you feel yourself getting burnt out  you need to address it immediately  even if it just involves taking vacation away from your partner for a week or      do not try to be super woman  sometimes  you have to prioritize things in terms of what is better for your mental health 
i say this with love  and not as any kind of advice   you are not required to set yourself on fire to make sure someone else is warm   not now and not ever    best of luck with everything  op 
  i hope you read this  it has advice  but it s how to help him  not to dump him     look  i have a chronic illness myself  and an alphabet soup of mental health conditions  so i kinda get what he s going through  i m not going to tell you to dump him  because my husband takes good care of me  despite a number of issues relating to depression  anxiety  cptsd  ocd  bipolar    and some other physical issues i have  he doesn t complain  he makes me think of how you two have taken care of each other during low points   however  he needs to work on himself  if you keep doing everything for him  he ll never get the push he needs to help him climb out of this rut  being active by doing chores and such can give a little boost of accomplishment  which can be very productive toward recovering  he needs to help care for the pets  because helping small creatures thrive and receiving their affection can also be a good start  only a little at first  like doing the laundry or taking pets for short walks could help him work through his pain  and as he starts getting used to doing tasks again  more chores and  normal  daily living can be added  do the stuff with him to help him be a little more confident  slow baby steps are the way to go  he s wounded  but you doing this sort of thing with him can start healing for both of you   you say you ve got therapy and medication  does he  if not  he needs to start  it s very important that he starts tending his own mental health  in the end  he has to  want  the professional help  or it won t do much good  maybe have sessions together so he doesn t have to face this stuff alone  face the problems side by side  you re a team   i think staying with him through this challenge is for the best  and as long as you work with him and he takes care of his mental health  this relationship can slowly recover and be healthier for it  don t forget your own self care   i wish both of you the best of luck  this must be a huge struggle for both of you  but you can help him start managing things again  take great care of yourselves and each other  just like you have been  you re stronger together 
this sounds like a toxic codependent relationship  hope you both take the time to help yourselves so you can be better partners to each other 
you can love somebody with your whole heart and they can still not be the person for you  i loved my ex but we were very toxic for one another  i loved my mom and would have given my entire life for her but that love wasn t enough to erase all of the bad things    i believe i have undiagnosed bpd  cptsd  and insomnia  i have diagnosed anxiety and depression  i have been with my husband for   years and a lot has happened in that time  a lot of life altering  soul shattering things  most days  i wish i could have a permanent nap but i still get up everyday and fight  my husband deserves a partner who s present  who helps take care of our pets  our house  and our marriage  i struggle every day but every day i also strive to get better and be better  not just for me but for my husband  that s how much i love him 
you don t have to leave him right this second  but i would definitely recommend having a serious conversation with him where you tell him you cannot continue on like this  tell him he must get help because this isn t healthy for either one of you and that you ll have to walk away if he cannot start trying  i understand you love him  and it does sound like he did a lot to help you  so i get why you don t want to just leave  but this is a bad situation for both of you  he has begun relying on you for literally everything  and you have become his caretaker and enabler  he must begin doing the work to get through this if you want a chance for your relationship to continue 
well cool but right now you are the only one giving in this relationship  how long is there gonna be enough water in the well to keep pouring 
i have no input on whether you should stay with him but for the record this isn t what love is  this is called enabling 
 removed 
it s not about what you re doing but his lack of willingness to do anything    as the old saying goes  you can lead a horse to water but you can t make it drink    maybe have a sit down with him and a serious chat about the strain it s putting on you and while you know and understand you can t keep going on this way  he either needs to accept and actively get help or you need to walk away for your own sanity     sometimes love isn t enough 
yikes  i mean it sounds like he doesn t put effort into getting on his feet again  sounds like coddle and hold his hand instead helping him put effort into getting better  he s weighing you down 
accelerated tms is showing really promising results and is viable for many where other treatments aren t possible   such as ketamine  there is a tim ferriss podcast episode     year random show   that shares some info on tms and the results for depression and anxiety  good luck
i ll preface this by saying i m not giving advice  just a thought or two from a woman in a similar situation  you clearly love each other a lot  i can tell that much  and i can certainly relate  i have a fiance who was with me when i was facing homelessness and grief and loss and more  now that he s struggling  i m sacrificing a lot to be there for him  that s love  i agree i don t necessarily think that leaving your bf is the right move  relationships look different to the people inside them  so  when your parents or his parents tell you to leave him    they re saying that with an outside perspective  a lot of time  outside perspectives are good  but i m not sure that s the case here  sometimes an outside perspective can illuminate you to mistreatment or toxicity  but from what you ve said  that doesn t seem the case at all  you re very adamant that he s been with you at your lowest  which means he truly does love you  i don t know if you ve talked to him about your exhaustion and how this is all affecting you  but just a teeny tiny bit of advice if you re willing to hear it  that might be his wake up call  he s sacrificed for you in the past  he loves and cares for you  if you show him what all this is doing to you  it might be the push he needs to get some help and start working on himself 
you dont have to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm   i get it you love him and want to take care of them but i think you guys should start having some hard conversations about him starting to get help for himself   i just dont want you to end up burnt out and resentful because you have so much on your plate  he does need to step up and start getting the help he needs which i understand feels almost impossible in the midst of depression but it is possible and you know that because you did it 
why come to this sub if you don t want anyone to comment like write the shit in your notes app if you need to vent lol
enabling vs helping  sometimes one needs to take their crutch and get out of the way so another can seek the help they actually need 
as someone with a chronic illness  it sounds like he is doing his best   he ll understand if you leave  he probably already has fears of holding you back   if you leave  leave on your terms   shut down everything everyone else says  fuck em   you know they just want to cast him aside because they don t want to deal with him being sick  it ll actually hurt him more if you leave under their influence  trust me on that   i ve gone through it  how everyone looks at him like a lazy ass and a loser  how they kinda wish he would die just so they didn t have to see him sick  it fucking sucks  but he ll understand 
so according to all the wise people here  you should leave him and perhaps leaving him is helping him    first scenario  you take their advise and leave him and he picks himself up and gets better  but he never forgives you for leaving him at his lowest or maybe he does and understands why you did it    second scenario  you leave him and it gets worse  his father left  died  and you the most important person in his life also leaves and then he decides he can t take anymore and attempts to end it all  you won t forgive yourself and none of the wise people on here will console you in person cos they don t know you and they don t care to be honest     third scenario  you reduce your care for him but keep your watchful eyes on him just enough for him to do stuff himself  you re present but not too present and see what happens  maybe he gets better  maybe not  worth a try     in the end you decide 
here s the thing  i suffer from clinical depression  a couple of years ago  there was a   month stretch where i was practically catatonic  my brain was telling me to end it because i was such a burden to everyone around me  especially my husband  i wasn t capable of doing anything beyond sleeping     hours a day and then sitting on the couch staring at the middle distance  my husband took care of absolutely everything  he made sure there was something i could eat in the house with next to zero effort  he d encourage me to shower and brush my teeth and made sure i had clean clothes  he d call and check on me during the day and make sure my friends and family did too  but i was trying to get better  i took my meds regularly  talked to my doctors and worked to get better  you absolutely cannot save someone from themselves  depression sucks and it lies to you but  you have to fight that if you can  i realize that some people cannot   this guy is not doing anything to get better  what happens if you cycle down again and there s no one to do all the work that you re doing  that would be dire  i get that you love him  i get that he was supportive in the past  but  now  he s not being a partner at all  and not even trying to get to a place where he can be one again 
anyone got a tldr 
oh brother
you re his mother  not his girlfriend  best of luck to you
only you know him  you love him and he loves you  he clearly needs you now as you ve needed him before  there s nothing wrong here  just make sure you re taking care of yourself too  even if that means distancing yourself from negative energy from those around you  make sure you can rely on yourself  do what you can  but don t overwork yourself more than you have to because you know this can go on for some time  i support you  you ve got this 
this is one of those situations where everyone  including you  is correct  he s sick and he needs help but he s unwilling to get it  he may be unwilling to get help as long as you stay with him but at get worse if you don t stay  you say we will get through it but as others pointed out  there is no  we  right now  only you  i completely get dating to marry and my husband was incredibly sick when we were dating  to the point that he literally died on the side of the road and i had to perform chest compressions for almost    minutes  we had the same worry you had about brain damage and he took  months to even be able to sit up or swallow food after his heart transplant  i get it  after all that and covid  some really terrible stuff happened in our lives and he really struggled  every drop step i the way the only thing i demanded was that he fight for himself and for us  there were points where he was barely squeaking by but he was fighting  compare that to the months before he was diagnosed when i begged him daily to go to a doctor and the former was much easier to deal with than the latter  even though it was so much worse in every other way  what does he want  have you asked him  does he want you to stay or is he hoping you ll leave  does he want you to live like this and love someone like him  does he think you deserve better   you do  he needs to start making choices out you will ultimately fail even if you don t leave 
i wish you luck and send support  nobody will be able to change your mind anyway  so i send you a warm hug if it helps  you ve got this  ask for help if you need to    you re stubborn and strong  i like you 
ok so continue as you are then   all the best
i think you need to take a step back from all the help or he will never stand for himself    i can empathize so much with this  my ex is still living with me and depending on me because i held them up but didn t hold them accountable because i didn t want them to suffer   my ex before that was abusive  predatory and has unmedicated schizophrenia and refused to get help till i left   because i made these people feel like they could just keep on relying on me because i didn t want anybody to hurt  i m a terrible people pleaser to my own detriment   i don t think you should leave  but space  for a while  not forever  could help him get the motivation to get better for himself with the aid of therapy 
happiest redditor couple
i am sorry for what you are going through  i know a lot of people don t like to hear what i have to say but i am going to say it anyways  turn to god  i went through some deeeep depression and my mother in law kept pushing god on me  at first  it felt annoying but eventually i opened up my heart to him and invited him into my life and my marriage and it was the best thing that could ve happened to me  jesus is the way  
op  i am not a therapist  a lot of people here are telling you that you   your bf are co dependent  and that you leaving him will actually help him  but you have made it clear in your post that you aren t interested in leaving  which you clearly see as abandoning him after he was there for you for the first two years    your bf suffered the one two punch of almost dying himself  and then losing his father to the thing that almost killed him  i cannot imagine the grief he has been dealing with  and it s no wonder he s depressed  i feel like he lives every day with the low level fear  or maybe overwhelming fear  that he will die that day  that is a lot for the brain to process  in the intervening years  he has fallen into a depression so deep  you have to remind him to brush his teeth  your bf  as you obviously know  needs professional help  do you two still live with his parents  because if so  living with the family who believes asking for mental health help or taking medication makes you weak is working against everything you are doing to help your bf  his family is even telling you to leave him  you know if you do  they won t help him  everything they are doing is inhibiting any progress you might make  you need to get out of that house   as for your bf  you need to start encouraging him to do things for himself or to  help  you do things  when it is time to do laundry  say to him   come with me  we re going to do laundry   make him go with you to the laundry room and help you  even if that means watching you at first  after you do that a few times  try handing him the basket of dirty clothes and saying   can you throw these in the washer for me  you remembered how we did it  right   don t treat him like a child but help him like he s a child  do you know what i mean by that  also  do that with other chores  like making dinner or making the bed or cleaning the bathroom or going to the bank or grocery store  get him involved  some days he may not be up for it  and at first he might say no or just ignore you  but you doing everything is  as others have said  enabling him to do nothing  and as a result he is not getting better   you can t do everything for him  you are only one woman  and not only don t others help you  they encourage you to give up and leave  yes  your bf needs professional help  so you have to encourage him to get there  keep it a secret from his family  if need be  tell him it will be your secret until he feels strong enough to tell people  remind him of all the wonderful ways he helped you through your depression and how much better you feel now  and tell him you want that for him   it s possible you cannot help him  but i understand that you don t want to give up on him  you ve been through some shit together  he was there for you when your life was crumbling  you love him and want him to get well  do you still see a therapist  talk to your therapist about what you should do  as if they know someone who can help him  maybe you can schedule appointments together  and you can tell his family he is driving you to therapy  but somehow he needs to get past being told getting help is weak so he  can  get the help he clearly needs    his family sounds kind of shitty  actually  why would anybody actively work  against  help and treatment for someone they love  that makes no sense to me    keep trying to help him  but make it more of an interactive help  where he is working with you  it might not work  and in another year  you make have a difficult decision to make  but i hope he breaks out of this depression and gets help  you sound like a good soul  just don t break yourself trying to fix him   hugs    
why people who don t have energy to brush their teeth or shower of change clothes always have so many pets  unless they are pet rocks  they need so much physical activity  mental stimulation  also good food and clean environment
op  get the book  boundaries  by cloud and townshend and read it  if you grew up in an abusive situation  it is very likely you donteven really understand how important they are  and remember  the only thing you can do is change yourself and the way you think live  i also thought i could love my ex enough to fix him  that s not how people work  though  and you are treading a very slippery path  either way  i truly hope the best for both of you  and i hope your story ends in a way that is positive for the both of you  love is a two way street for a reason 
just curious  why did you come here asking for advice on another post if you didn t want it  like not judging  i m just genuinely curious 
you can t love him enough or do enough to help him out of this hole  you know this because you ve crawled out of your own hole    i know it s hard to hear but right now you are enabling him  he doesn t need to go out and  get help  because you are doing everything he needs to stay alive  he can t hit rock bottom unless he is allowed to    you are setting yourself on fire to warm your bf  you are destroying your own mental health for someone who is not helping themselves    your friends and family are right  you need to step back  focus on yourself and let him drown  i know it s hard but you aren t responsible for what happens to him  all you are doing right now is delaying the inevitable and the longer he is allowed to stay in this state  the harder it will be to pull himself out of it 
the cruelty in the comments makes me want to vomit  op i assure you that if it had been a man talking about his partner all the comments would have told him to find a way to help her  but since he is a man then he doesn t deserve pity  he doesn t deserve to being loved  this means being men  having a society that dumps you at the first difficulty because you are just a burden  for my part  i can tell you that it is truly praiseworthy that you are there for him  as you yourself say  he did for you  in this world of heartless individuals who only aim for personal satisfaction and are extremely selfish  as many in the comments  that s really commendable  having said that it s clear that you can t wait forever  at some point otherwise you won t be able to take it anymore  it s time you sat down with him face to face and explain to him how you re struggling and how it is necessary for him to wake up and decide to fight  to cure himself  to do therapy  because you can no longer shoulder all the weight of both of you  and therefore if he believes in this relationship  then he must fight for it and also for himself  also because if you always take care of everything  you don t push him at all to have to do something and you enable his   depression   because he has someone who does everything for him  things have to change to continue this relationship  that s for sure 
none of those who are commenting are understanding you  it s not a good idea to vent your immense love here  i hope that with time  your beloved one recovers   but also encourage him to take therapy  it s nice to have someone at your side who looks after you and he s lucky for that  but you must also actively focuses on involving a specialist in this with you  good luck to both of you            
i didn t come here for relationship advice  frankly i don t care what anyone thinks about our relationship  i came here to get something off my chest  that s it 
you are an amazing partner  that fact that you ve been in that dark hole before gives you knowledge of where his mind is at and gives you an insight that many people don t have  you have empathy and compassion for him and what he s currently going through    while it is true  he is not helping himself  but maybe he s just not quite there yet  you are the one constant in his life right now  that s a good thing  just know that if things turn for the worst for him  none of it is your fault  you are doing the best for him  you are his rock  just be there and love him today  do it again tomorrow when he wakes up  rinse and repeat    encourage him everyday to try something new from going for a walk with you to reading a book to trying a new hobby like painting or pottery  creative art is great medicine for the depressed mind   do these things with him  at least to start 
if you re not interested in biased opinions from people unhappy in their relationship or unable to even have one altogether  you ve come to the right place 
please op read it     please please please     don t leave him     i am begging you      after reading all this i can say that he is not bad  he is really good  and those people who are saying you should leave him  just think about all the things he has done for you  he really loves you   it s not right to leave the one you love bcs he has mental problems  you should help him   you just can t break a relationship of   years  please don t   it s easy to break relationship but it s really hard to make a relationship  so don t break it   please don t hear these comments and break up with him       bcs breaking up with him may give adverse reaction  he may turn suicidal bcs he is already depressed  when he sees that the only person that cared about him is leaving him  he may feel super broken and may end up committing suicide        in a relationship you are supposed to help each other  so please continue to help him    and another thing  try to make him do some of his work  he may become lazy      please don t break this wonderful relationship  he has given you a better life  so you shouldn t leave him      those people who are saying you to break up    do they know the  meaning of love       you need to do some sacrifices and he also sacrificed for you    i am from a traditional buddhist family that s why i may sound old     i m sorry  but i just believe that   a person have only one soulmate 
i have never read a story here that comes closer to what some may describe as unconditional love  i really wish you both the greatest outcome  i am totally rooting for you    yes  it is true  nobody knows what will happen  nobody knows the future  may be they are right and you are wrong  but let me tell you none of these people have ever come close to what you both have   so let time do the thing and see where it takes you  but do not let other people tell you what you want to get out of this experience  play for the win  give your best  don t expect anything  but accept every outcome  there is no other  secret sauce  to win   you make your own rules  and you are already far far ahead of most of us  don t look back  do what you have to do and enjoy wherever it takes you  in the end you have only to life with yourself and you can be proud of what you have already achieved  you are so strong  please teach us how you got this strong  we should all listen to you and learn from you  how are you so good in this thing called love 
why should he save himself when he has someone who does it for him all the time
she will end up burned out either staying her whole life also depressed either leaving but feeling empty from giving too much for years 
you can lead a horse to water 
completely      agree with this  my first two relationships were like this  i loved them so so deeply and felt exactly the way op felt  held the same view and did the same work  however i failed to realize that it doesn t matter how hard i love them  how hard i take care of them  how much i push them to start working on their mental health  they have to be the ones to hold themselves up  pick themself up  do the work for themselves    i don t regret anything i had done for them  i still hold the same views to an extent  but as you said there comes a time when you have to realize that you are enabling them  and sometimes the best thing you can do for someone you love is take a step back  not saying to distance or break up  but just take it a little easier  give them a little room to grow on their own  it hurts like hell to do that  and it s fucking hard because all you want is to give them the world  give them everything have ever wanted  but sometimes you have to do hard things because you love them so much 
its like forcing a drug addict into rehab  won t work unless its of their own free will  at this point  shes just got him on life support 
i ve been in a similar relationship  her partner will think this is  the new normal   i helped my current partner for    months   i told him i couldn t do it much longer if i didn t see him put any effort into helping himself  he s doing much better now    don t put your partner on a pedestal  just because he did so much for her  doesn t mean he has a free pass to do nothing for himself  she needs to tell him that he needs to start helping himself or she can no longer support him  she s making it worse for him unintentionally 
op please listen to this  he helped you through  sure  and you did a lot yourself  you went to therapy  you worked on the issues  and you made the change to move in a different direction  that s a ton of work and you showed up for the relationship by doing those things    he isn t doing the same work  he s not showing up  you are signing up to do this every day and not have time and energy for other pursuits    he needs to go to therapy and start the work  it is understandable at first if he didn t  and he cannot keep staying in that rut  he will rot there  if your therapist allows  you could offer a couples session to get him started  you can continue to support him  just be aware that his helping you is not the same as you helping him  he was supporting you as you worked on yourself  you are supporting him as he continues to go deeper into depression 
yeah  it sounds like the bf and op may have become codependent    when you re codependent  consciously or unconsciously  you slowly but surely stop having the self motivation and confidence to be independent  in the bf s case  this means he loses any drive to actually pursue and put effort into self improvement or even self maintenance  and instead relies on op for those things  in op s case  this means you begin to feel overly responsible for the physical and mental wellbeing of your partner  both of them are fighting to maintain that codependence because over time  they ve become unable to define the love between them or even their own separate sense of self without it    the bf can t leave because without op  he feels like he has nothing keeping his head above water  and op has been supporting him for so long that he likely doesn t remember how to keep himself afloat    op can t leave because they feel too responsible for their bf  they are aware that they are single handedly what s keeping him afloat and can t bear the thought of leaving him to drown  it hasn t occurred to them that just treading water  for  him isn t the same as actually teaching him to do so himself  they are at this point directly contributing to the codependency and their partner s lack of self drive to improve his own life and mental state    it s not a healthy or sustainable position for  either  party  if they go on as they are now  they ll just  both  end up underwater  the bf will cling to op and op will cling to him  both in an effort to keep just him afloat  until they  both  drag each other down    there is a difference between supporting someone and just straight up carrying them  supporting someone means letting them lean on you until they re able to walk on their own again  completely carrying someone for long enough means that they will just forget how to walk on their own 
i left my ex because of this and he still hasn t changed  but complains that he has
agree  you can t fix someone who doesn t want to get better  what will they do if something traumatic happens to her  will he step up and take care of the the same way she has been doing for him  somehow  i doubt it  
yup  as my therapist once said   sometimes you just have to let him fail  he s never going to learn if he never has to deal with the consequences of his actions  
excellent insight   you can t save someone who doesn t want to save themselves    op  you must know this deep in your heart  you have your own issues  my list is very very similar to yours   and you know the importance of getting professional help  doing the work in therapy  taking the meds needed to keep you stable    if your bf was doing the work but not making progress  my advice would be different  but this man is showing you that he s unwilling to do the work to be a functioning human  why would he  you re there  you re doing everything    i know you love him  but love has its limits  right now you need to love yourself and put yourself first  is this how you want to live for the next year  the next   years             years    you deserve more than this  please talk to your therapist about why you re accepting this behavior from your bf 
excellent taste in username btw  js
the last post i needed advice on how to further help him  i refuse to believe that walking away is my only option  what kind of person leaves someone at their lowest 
i like this comment bc she doesn t want people to tell her to leave but that s the realistic question  if no  you should leave  if you re cool w being a caretaker  stay
this comment gets it
i am in therapy  and he s not reciprocating constantly now because he s not well but i had a good   years of him being the best partner anyone could imagine while i was struggling with my mental health
she has a previous post of her having to look after her mother as a teenager  all this woman knows is caring for someone until she burns herself out  it s really sad honestly
this is exactly what it is  and it s not so much that she enjoys it  it s that it s terrifying to think about him not needing her to coddle him  if he doesn t need her to take care of him  then she s worthless and he ll leave her  so it s better for her to keep him acting like a helpless child    refused to get out of the car at a therapy appointment  refusing to talk to a therapist on telemed  is he fucking   years old      doesn t help at all around the house  wow what a shocking thing to hear  he s so unique and different to the other partners out there who take advantage of their sos  this is purposeful refusal to do anything to change his life  and why should he  she ll do it all for him  and then someday she ll wake up at    and realize she spent most of her life caring for other people who don t give a shit about her 
i don t enjoy it  at all  i just don t think that commitment and loyalty always have to be joyful  when we first met we were reversed  i was extremely depressed and his care and love gave me the strength to fight for myself  i m just trying to return the favor 
i have pure ocd so my standards for myself are high across the board constantly  he is our bread winner and pays most of our bills and gets a ride to work because i don t have a car and he wants me to be able to get around during the day  he doesn t  give me nothing  he just doesn t give himself anything   
she is being selfish harming him in the long run  she really needs to speak to her therapist about this because she seems totally blinded by her behaviour and how it is harming him
or maybe she s just not a selfish person like everyone today
this
i do  i told him i wanted to go back to school because i was drifting  so he paid for my tuition  my car broke down so he gave me his and found a ride to work  when i was with my abusive mother he held my hand while i called her out and got my sister removed from the home with cps  when the time comes that i need him he is always there 
my relationship isn t  super special  i just think people forget what a relationship actually is  it s not always perfect it s not always easy and it s not always fair  that s what i mean  love is action  not just a feeling  if you aren t willing to give all you have to the person you love i don t think it s real love 
yes and he pays all of our bills    lol
in what way am i relishing in this  being willing to do something doesn t mean in licking up every second and enjoying the situation  like what the fuck
you re soooooo right i just love having to support the man i love while i watch him lose himself in sadness after i ve already watched his father die and him almost actually die  it s so fun and i enjoy every second  
my mental health is just fine at the moment  better than it s been in a while  i m on a new medication that seems to be working well for me  why shouldn t i be proud that i m willing to give everything to the person i love instead of throwing things away when they get hard 
it isn t hard at all  and nobody needs to be saved from him  he s simply depressed after having a few traumatic events 
p s  life and relationships can t always be        sometimes it s        sometimes       or sometimes even        and it s okay for it to be like that sometime  and you must not punish your partner for feeling low  it simply will traumatize them into believing that they re disposable just because they aren t feeling good 
he s worth everything
i m not hurting  the only thing that hurts is the idea that he doesn t see himself like i do 
people are so selfish to claim to love someone and not be willing to be uncomfortable for any amount of time 
  depression  
the best things in life take hard work and the most rewarding things in life aren t easy 
yes  i ve needed him before and he s never let me down  everything i ve done he s done for me it just has never lasted this long or felt this severe
this is something i was trying to explain but you have explained far better  i wish op would listen but she s got her fingers in her ears at this point
this is something i was trying to explain but you have explained far better  i wish op would listen but she s got her fingers in her ears at this point
this is what will likely happen because she is low associated with his depressive stage of his life  i hope not but the way op is responding to comments and her edits make me think that this relationship is part of what is keeping them both down   and he ll realise that before she does
that s what i m saying  i know him better than anyone  i know him  i know that i m helping because i see the difference it makes  i don t do his laundry because he ll have dirty laundry  i do his laundry because i like the way he perks up a little when he s able to walk into work smelling good  with confidence  i remind him to brush his teeth because   ew   and i notice that he s more affectionate and smiles more when he s clean  i don t cook for him because he ll starve  but because i know he ll only eat junk that ll exacerbate his medical issues  and i know he wakes up easier when he s eaten all of the veggies he should  i care about him  i love him  and he works hard to provide for us  he has a savings account that he s saving to buy me a car  he listens to intently to everything i say and keeps a note in his phone about every little thing about me he wants to remember  and when he s dark in bed i ll find him scrolling through an album on his phone of pictures of me    i know he s worth everything i do for him  because he knows i m worth everything he s doing for me  he just needs to bet on himself as much as he bets on me
so you  a random person on the internet knows better than his and her family  you re advising her to isolate herself from anyone who tries to intervene  this is dangerous advice and sadly the only advice she will listen to because it fits with her view   look at her post history of being forced into a carer role at a young age and how that impacted her  look at her language   no one knows him like i do   i think other people just don t really love their partners    it s fine to give her hope and general advice but to tell her to cut off people who actually know her in real life and want to help her is really bad and dangerous advice
you re wrong   
i ve put effort into trying to get him to get better  but unfortunately his family thinks that mental illness isn t real and just an excuse  and that he just needs to pray and go to church to get the demon out   his mom heard that i go to therapy and thinks i m a bad influence for trying to get him on medication and in therapy  so she doesn t like our relationship  it s not easy to get    years of conditioning out of someone
 true off my chest 
i m not going anywhere  he s working full time and paying for the majority of our bills  he tells me all the time he understand if i have to leave but that s just so silly to me  he has a chronic illness and he s depressed  that doesn t make him lazy  he s trying really hard to
my bf almost died   years ago and then his dad died from the same chronic illness and now he s extremely depressed and i try to help him day to day  he helped me for years before with my mental health so i don t see anything wrong with helping him now but everyone is convinced i m wasting my   s 
most people with mental illness find pets give them a reason to get up in the morning and bring some joy into your life  and that s true for us  while i do a lot of the basic care  he loves to spend time with them  we have   lizards and   cats  we feed them all appropriately  cats eat wet food only  they get lickmats with ground organ meat a couple times a week they have   litter boxes and at least one piece of furniture for each of them in every room of the house along with about    water dishes scattered about including fountains  they see the vet twice a year minimum  they re both fixed  they see the groomers every other month and get brushed nearly every day  because they love it  and boyfriend loves to play with them  they play fetch and he gets a kick out of it   the lizards can only be handled once or twice a week and only really require spot cleaning and humidity checks because they re in bioactive enclosures and all of their heat lights are on automatic timers  we also have   cameras in each enclosure and bluetooth digital thermometers that notify us when they move around our if the temperature is fluctuating  they see the vet annually and have all of their vaccines  and they re even fixed just to avoid any reproductive problems down the line 
i wanted advice on how to help him but instead everyone just wanted me to leave him and said i was the reason he wasn t doing well and that he d be better off without me  i know that s not true so i came here to talk about the fact that people have too shallow of a view of what love is  people expect everything to be easy and it s just not
i don t think he or our relationship is disposable    just because it s difficult for us right now with his mental health doesn t mean that i should just abandon him at his lowest  he doesn t deserve that  especially when he was abused by his father who told him he deserved it  i d just be proving his father wrong  what kind of woman would do that  i couldn t imagine hurting him in that way  right now i can handle it  i am handling it  and i m tired of people acting like he s useless just because he s sad  it breaks my heart people don t see him like i do  especially him 
you cross posted in multiple advice subreddits  you were hoping for validation  obvious from your defensiveness   you are not fooling anyone 
i am  we re going to a paint and sip class this weekend    and we go on walks every evening after dinner
how he reacts to op leaving would only be his fault 
there is a fine line between helping and enabling 
op  i m a recovering alcoholic   bear with me   i promise it is relevant to your situation     my ex really loved me  and i loved him  and he thought that if he loved me enough and helped me enough  i would get better  he also believed if i loved him enough  i would get sober for him    the reality is that he enabled me  i had no reason to get sober cuz he was loving me no matter what  so why would i quit  truth is  he was loving me to death  literally  he meant well  but he was actually helping me slowly kill myself   i tried to get sober a few times   for him  for my son  for my family  but the reality is  a person can t change for someone else  they have to do it for themselves  period   it wasn t til he finally left me and i had to take care of myself that i finally found the strength to get sober  him leaving me was painful but it was the best thing that ever happened to me   if you really love yourself and your bf  you need to walk away  that doesn t mean forever  but it does mean for right now til he gets better    you two sound very codependent  that s sooo unhealthy   don t light yourself on fire to keep him warm   good luck to you both 
exactly  build a man a fire and he s warm for a night  light a man on fire and he is warm for the rest of his life 
but you damn sure can t make  em drink
but it s considered bad form to hold their head under it til they drink 
excellently put  no notes   i really hope op reads this  but something tells me that even if she did  she d dismiss it out of hand     everyone s telling her  in regards to the bf  that you can t save someone that doesn t want to save themselves  ironically  the same applies to op  because of everything you outlined above   until she recognizes what s actually happening and does something to remedy it  nothing will ever change 
sorry  i shouldn t have been so absolute because there are definitely situations like that  the issue is still the same though  him 
omg same   he still won t see a therapist or pay me back  he hasn t worked on himself at all  but he says he has  
it s not a binary choice  you don t have to walk away or stay and make your entire life about caring for him   you re young  your post history explains you were a caretaker far too young and now you re in that position again  you know that childhood you ll never get back  you ll never get this time back either   leaving may be the spark he needs to help himself  if that s not something you want to do  perhaps you can find way of helping him help himself more   at the end of the day   you loved yourself enough and him enough to try and get better from your lowest  currently he doesn t love either of you enough to try   i ve experienced something similar to the both of you and has hard as it was  i believe what saved me was that i didn t have a safety net  i literally had to get better or rot  i had to work to survive  i hope you can find a way to help him and you can both be happy together but if you carry on as you are  nothing will or can change 
you are not leaving him  you are allowing him to live his life  this is not your mental health journey  it is his  and you are forcing his stagnation babying him  he needs a wake up call and he needs drive neither of which he has with your saviour complex  walk away  keep in contact with his parents as they seem to care about him and you  this is not goodbye or the end  it is him needing time to face his problems instead of being enabled by you  you can always return to him once he improves in a year or so  you need to talk to your therapist about this your mindset is heavily flawed
you claim to love him  but refuse to do the only thing that will actually help     stop enabling him or admit you are doing this all for yourself and don t give a shit about him 
what if he won t ever get any better  then what  the problem is that you can t help people that don t want to help themselves  that s a hard lesson to learn  are you willing to live like this for the rest of your life  at which point will you say  enough  
you can t further help him  he has to help himself  maybe giving him room to do so where he isn t enabled to do nothing is the right answer 
there are things to do before leaving  have you talked to him about a therapist or medication  is he doing anything to actively get away from his lowest  you can be there for him       but only he can pull himself out   i ll give you some examples  when my husband and i were first living together  he lost his job unexpectedly  and it was really difficult  especially because we were in the middle of the      recession  he got discouraged and depressed  and i was there to listen  but i was also there to keep him applying  keep him moving  he did of course get a job  and everything got better because we worked on it together   a few years ago  i had a literal mental breakdown  caused by a lot of different things  it was a slow decline of depression until i was actively suicidal  my husband listened to me  did extra housework  and made sure i was safe  but he also helped me find a good therapist through our insurance  he asked me to ask my doctor about increasing the dosage of my anti depressants  he made sure that  i  kept moving this time  and again  things got better because  even though one of us was struggling hard  we  both  worked to get through it   it s beautiful and wonderful that you want to care for your boyfriend so much  but you can t force him back to himself by loving the sadness out of him  he has to take some active steps too  otherwise  it s just not fair to either of you 
just to give you some perspective  i was kinda in a similar state as your bf couple years ago  and i will say  my support walking away is actually what made me heal  i was able to take back responsibility and do what i needed to  i gained lots of confidence once i was done grieving the relationship  best thing that happened to me 
someone who values their own life  and won t waste their one chance of living by dragging someone along who won t move themselves 
you have to be willing to see past your opinion on the matter  when in reality the best advice is to walk away  and i m suggesting to walk away for good  but honey  at this point you are doing nothing but enabling that behavior  why on earth would he lift a finger to better the situation when he has you to basically wipe his ass for him  he s gotten so low and so used to it that change will not come without sacrifice  you have to be that sacrifice to light a fire under him and force his hand  if you stay  so will the behaviors 
i really understand where you are coming from and how much you ve supported each other through  it s not easy to find a partner who ll support you that way and it has been mutual  i understand why you want to stay and hope for things to get better    he is obviously terrified and really needs some help dealing with that  but you can t make him get help  right now you re understandably frustrated that he won t seek help but i think you feel like it s still early days    i guess the question is  how long can this continue before you begin to resent him for not doing all he can to get better  how many years of your life will you spend as his carer while he doesn t try  that s not a judgement  or for an answer at this point   just a genuine question to consider for yourself 
hey  look i ve been here too   if you have a therapist  they have probably talked to you about denial as a trauma response  if not  follow this up 
i m wondering if the family is telling her to leave because she is loving him to death  she seems to think sacrificing yourself is a virtue  it s a little scary and what she is focusing on in comments is very telling 
i don t appreciate you saying i m keeping him as a helpless child for my own benefit  it s incredibly rude and entirely wrong  he didn t need me to  coddle him  for almost   years before any of this happened and he still loved me  even if i were to have been afraid of him leaving me because he didn t  need  me  those fears would be long smashed by the fact he didn t  need  me for a majority of our relationship  he needs me now    his abusive father once beat him for asking to go to therapy  he called him a  weak pu  y  his mom to this day pokes fun at me and has hidden my medication saying i just need a demon removed from my soul  his family doesn t  and has never believed mental health to be an issue and he has listened to his parent berate and belittle people who go to a  shrink  and  admit defeat   it s going to take more than one or two attempts to get that kind of mindset out of a man  especially considering his mother is still a huge part of our lives    lastly  yeah  cleaning has fallen to the wayside for him at the moment  as it does for everyone at some point  and i m not going to live in filth after having grown up in a hoarder s house  and again  for the majority of our relationship  he s always been on top of it  but right now he needs support  but thanks for assuming i m wasting my life on someone who  doesn t give a shit about me   good to know that years of being a dedicated  loyal  loving  giving partner means absolutely nothing  whether that be the years he d been those things for me before this or the time i m trying to be those things now 
well if he s not in therapy how is he actively getting better  are you okay with his stagnation 
serious question  what happens when the tables turn in a month  ten months    if you lose your job  get in a car wreck  etc  the window for him to heal  while you can fully support him  can be slammed shut at any time    i do not think you should leave him  i think you need a reality check that you are enabling him and doing more harm by allowing him to wallow at his bottom  you need to start helping him rise up from the dark    you remind him to brush his teeth  fine  remind him to get a therapist  schedule him one and make him go  if he is so bad he won t bathe  work with his family to get him into inpatient treatment    if he had two broken legs and could not walk  no one would blink about you helping him out  but if he had two broken legs and would not see a doctor to get them set and healed  that would be fucking insane  he would die  and you would be allowing it    that is what is happening  you are letting the man he was  die right in front of you  fix the problem 
there s the difference though  you fought for yourself  he isn t  he won t get better until he s willing to put in the effort  and if it s been two years of nothing  you have to start realising that he s not going to  it wouldn t be you giving up on him  he s already given up on himself 
how long did he have to be your support in the beginning  did he do everything you re doing 
you aren t returning the favour though   you re enabling him  he s got himself into a pit and what you are doing is making it so cosy and comfortable down there that he has no reason to ever even think of climbing out   he needs professional help and to start the process of taking back responsibility for himself and his life  for both your sakes 
but you got help  you wanted to get better and did the right steps to do so  he isn t  so the only way to like this current relationship is liking that he depends on you 
 fight for myself   is he fighting for himself 
well he mimicked your personality now   lol  
hey girl  you obviously have a strong heart given your situation so you probably don t need this  but mad respect to you  for sticking to your morals and loving your person through the good and bad  if one day it s not for you that s your business but right now you said it what you want so f    all them unsolicited opinions   
so he only provides material things for you  but i see nothing of emotional needs being met  he cares not for you if he s not working on himself    true love doesn t like being a burden to their other half  they work hard and use the help provided   he doesn t love you  it s just a codependent relationship at this point  hun  i m sorry it sucks to hear  but this many people can t be wrong  even his family and friends are giving you the same advice 
are you prepared for this to be your life forever  you do so much for him as many have said  you are enabling him  so why would he change  you have told him you want him to go to therapy but he knows if he refuses to go  you will stay  i wish you luck but it sounds like this will be your  normal  forever   info  how can he work if he is this depressed  what does he do  edit  grammar
when did he do all this though       you spoke about these examples in your post as well  so like  okay  he did good stuff for you  but the question is  is he going to do that now    ever   you ve taken care of your abusive mother before  this is close territory  disucss this with your therapist  and maybe when the whole world is telling you the same thing  give them some credit 
the way you make it seem with the  you ve been taking care of everything  like he wasn t doing anything at all  might want to edit this post    so just tell everyone to mind their god damn business  you and him are the only ones in this relationship 
is he giving you all he s got  
your boyfriend isn t willing to give it all he has  he won t even take the first step to try   work on his depression    even by your own logic you have a one sided relationship     the people closest to you want you to break up because they see how draining it is on you 
good then he should be able to figure out how therapy works  your dynamic is unhealthy and will eventually lead to divorce  one day you will wake up and realize that you have been enabling him not helping him but you are so deep in it and so young you cannot see that right now   his need for you is filling some void from your childhood trauma and i d be willing to bet you basically raised yourself  but he s adding to your trauma and is very toxic for you   frankly i don t care if boy is paying all your bills i personally don t believe in being financially dependent on others  fine if you re cool with that i m just am not and it certainly doesn t replace emotional and mental support or sharing in the mental load of running a household    i think you are falling into the mother fallacy but noting i or anyone else say will change that for you  that much is evident in the number of people who have already said this to you including his own family and you re still on the internet trying to get a    th opinion  you cannot save him and it isn t your responsibility to  don t let this boy drown you to save himself 
you re literally pretending everyone in the world is wrong and you re the only one who s right and truly in love  you re lying to yourself to make it seem like you re doing something special and good  you re not  you re enabling your partner 
you re not listening to what they re saying  which is fine  its your thread  you did say that since you are doing all this  anyone who wouldnt doesnt love their partners  but youre not really helping him  he doesnt want to get better  and since youre doing everything for him  he can just keep doing nothing 
you should never need to sacrifice yourself for someone else  why are you giving everything  what are you getting in return  this is a very unhealthy way to approach relationships  have you told your therapist this  i would read to them this comment 
op you re a sweet girl but in the long run you will be hurt  you re just holding on to his past self  you can t safe someone who doesn t want to be safe  and it s hard to hear that   but again your life your choice  i wish you all the luck you will be needing that 
i completely agree  every person commenting here apparently sees relationships as being transactional and rational when it s the complete opposite  i m with my husband because i love him  not because of what he does or doesn t do for me  love isn t rational  and i m not gonna call it quits that easily  yes it s not exactly       but what things in life ever are  relationships are work  hard work  people are forgetting that  period 
depression is an illness  treat it  medicate it  give it therapy  and let the patient do their work    after that  it s just a bullshit excuse like any other    i ve been the depressed person  and i ve had depressed family members  at some point  you re just aiding and abetting 
there s also strength in finding yourself and knowing when to walk away when you enable someone to not want to get treatment  you are not helping him  you are holding him back from getting better  you seem to think that if you stick with him and baby him like he did for you when you were depressed he will get better  mental health is not linear  his mental health is not your battle and his battle is not the same as the one you went through  he needs a different approach  he has stagnated for years because he is comfortable with you doing everything forever    this is not a partner he is abusing your kindness even if he is unaware  his own family are telling you to leave him so he can focus on himself and you are refusing  you are being selfish  you claim you are in therapy and i highly recommend discussing this with them  your drive to push your help and fight for someone who has done nothing in return is not healthy for either of you  you are harming his journey  he is not in a state to be in a relationship  taking a break to work on yourself and for him to be pushed to work for himself is for the best  in a year you can check in on him and see if he has improved but honestly you need to accept that walking away is for the best for you and him  he has a family who obviously care enough about you and him to tell you to stop  your constant refusal is not out of love it is out of selfishness 
i love that op   you are so loyal and sweet and thoughtful  whitcomb mine came around  and now  he  wants to do everything for me and our son  he is great   if i had left   i can t imagine my live without hiim     proud of you 
i do not take time to read up on people s past posts usually  i specifically said my advise blah and how to do blah  not isolate yourself or thay i know better than anyone  you on the other hand seems to me thinks to believe you know best  you skimmed my post obviously or simply do not understand setting boundaries  you could take another look  no harm  bc i ve certainly given no dangerous advise     go on though  seems like you re going to have more to say  just do is both the service of reading my actual words  bc you ve misunderstoid   very minimum  at maximum you don t comprehend well  just let me know    
ok boo  i hope i am
okay but why write a whole paragraph on how everything people will say will fall on deaf ears then    if you actually didn t want anyone to leave a comment or give feedback you d write it somewhere where no one could do it  i think you know that you need advice support which is why you wrote it here 
totally agree  i m sure he has a stronger will than those that cast him down    will is all you have sometimes    sounds like he found himself a really great lady    good wishes to you both 
sounds like he s even hinting that you should leave  so everyone including him thinks you should leave  but suuuuure babe you know better    it s gonna work out great 
well  i guess that s the problem  if he won t accept help  sometimes the best thing to do is either give it time  which you ve already done  and it s clearly not helping  or leave and do some thing that s better for you  you re spending all of your time on him  and from how you describe it  it sounds unfair and unhealthy   don t you think there s a reason why all of your friends and family  and even his family  are telling you to leave  i know that you said you won t listen to anyone  but i m just saying as someone who has watched this happen multiple times  it s not going to help anything  taking care of him for a time makes sense  but at some point  he s gotta accept help and try to help himself and he s not doing that  that s how my loved one was  and it ended up hurting all of us   i already had mental health issues  but trying to help with him and trying to support those who were supporting him sent me into a deeper depression and exacerbated my anxiety  you said you have depression as well as other issues  please please please try to take care of yourself  that s all i ask    like i said  i know you won t listen to me if i tell you to leave  no one in my family listens to me when i try to tell them any of this  i just asked that you please take care of yourself and think of yourself  love is hard  but it shouldn t have to be this hard 
unfortunately today s society is extremely selfish  it no longer tells you to fight for the people you love but to think only and only about you  an extremely selfish society  the famous  in good times and bad  in health and in sickness  no longer counts nothing  moreover if the victim is a man  then he doesn t deserve any mercy  as i have already said  however  the fact that you do everything does not help your boyfriend  he must undergo therapy  take medications  he must find the strength to get back up  for this reason you must have a serious conversation and you must explain that you can no longer take on the burden of everything   he must understand how tired you are and how you are struggling in this relationship and he must fight personally  i also strongly recommend couples therapy  because you need a professional to open his eyes and can help you on how to progress step by step
this post was not cross posted to any subreddits  i m not seeking anything but to get something off my chest per the subreddit this is posted in 
and the advice i was seeking had nothing to do with wanting to leave him  or knowing if i should stay or not  it was advice on any other ways i could help him  i get it  everyone thinks i m what s wrong with him  that he d be better off without me  super cool  idgaf  i m not going anywhere  he won t be left while he s at his lowest so sorry everyone 
that s wonderful  accomplishing stuff like painting is a huge boost in those feel good feelings  i ve been wanting to do stuff like that with my husband  he s not always in his happy place and will sit in his dark hole every now and then   maybe i ll try to do that again  we too go on walks when we can and his mood has been improving 
i don t know what you mean but i think you don t agree with me and you are saying that she should leave him     umm     it s up to her   she won t leave him i know       but i would really feel bad for the guy  if she left him  i mean he saved her from her mother s abuse  paid all of her study fees  bought her everything he can  gave her car    cared for her  treated her well when she had depression     so now he is mentally not right  so she should stay with him right   he loves her and she loves him  so why should she leave him     just asking  will you leave your lover if he she gets some bad mental condition  i don t know about you   i am sorry for being like a old guy but i won t ever leave them   i really don t understand why people downvoted me   i would be really greatful if you or anyone else could explain me the negetive behaviour of fellow humans towards my opinion      thanks 
but it can be so hard to see that line when you love someone so much who s supported you at your all time lows when no one else was there  i get where op is coming from  is there anyway you can directly sit him down and let him know that you need him to meet you half way  i don t think abandoning him is the right answer  but idk  maybe i can be a bit codependent  the way i d look at it is i would feel like leaving him would be abandoning him and that s not helpful  but being honest with him and let him know you need him to meet you halfway  op 
this part
this  op  this is gold    you need to hear what she s trying to tell you because  if you don t  you will destroy both of you 
oof  that is so like my experience with my late partner  except i was the carer enabler   his addiction ended up killing him 
thank you for sharing even though op isn t ready to hear this and apparently didn t come here for advice according to the edit  hopefully your story will reach someone who is ready   congratulations on your sobriety i know it isn t easy 
i hope op sees this  it s perfect
this brought me to tears  it is so hard learning this   i hope you are in a better place now  assuming because you said recovering     you are so right  you need to want to change for yourself  not others 
i firmly believe that unconditional love is only healthy when it goes from parent to child  yet we all think that s the goal because that is the first love we re offered  even if it s not unconditional most parents won t actually say it isn t  which seems hella confusing   l
my mom had to walk away from my dad in order for him to wake up and get sober  he s been sober for decades now  she did go back to him  but she realized that the only way for her to save us was to let the ship sink and put herself and us kids on the lifeboat  if he wanted to join us  he could  it took him a while  but he did it 
preach sista 
believe what you want i guess
op said in another comment that they scheduled a therapy appointment and drove him there but he refused to go inside  and then they made an appointment with a telehealth person and he refused to talk to the therapist and was upset for days at op   
i have another comment basically saying just that  her mindset is very flawed and i think it is obvious her help is not longer help but hindering any progress he makes because she makes him comfortable suffering  she has a therapist and obviously needs to sort through her own stuff  her boyfriend also needs to sort himself out  a break to work on themselves would really be the best here for everyone
no offense but you wouldn t be aware of it if that s what was happening  my husband and i have both been in this position and we dealt with it promptly  as in  we are both medicated now  you have to wonder why he isn t and why you re okay with him not taking care of it 
i was in your position with my ex girlfriend  four years of being a  dedicated  loyal  loving  giving partner   she broke up with me because she fell out of love with me  i strongly suspect it was because i was in the caretaker role rather than the equal partner role   i was baffled how she could just throw away four years of endless financial and emotional support and free labor  but a situation like that creates a clear difference in roles  she contributed nothing  i contributed everything  and eventually she no longer saw me as a romantic interest because i was simply her caretaker 
i ve already scheduled a therapy appointment  took him to the building and he refused to walk in  then i found one on telehealth and he refused to speak and was upset with me for days  i m always talking to his friends and family and encouraging him to go out with them when they have something going on  to the point i ve gone to see if he d come and he still didn t go  when i do laundry  i wash it all and ask him to hang up his half with me and he either does it or it sits in the hamper  when i make dinner  i ask his advice on seasonings and try to include him in the process  if i m in the middle of unloading the dishwasher and he walks by i hand him something to put away  it s not my fault he doesn t fold his half  or walks away after i give him one dish to put away  i m pushing and pushing and pushing him and i m sorry but i truly don t understand how it s my fault he s wallowing when all i ve ever done is fight for him  i talked to the doctor he was seeing and followed her advice  and now the food i m cooking has blended up veggies in the sauce for extra vitamin intake  i m always dragging him outside with me on walks for vitamin d and exercise  i don t know what more people are saying i could be doing for him  honestly 
everything and more  he washed my hair for me at one point  the first time i cried in front of him he called off of work for a week and drove me across our state to shower me with gifts and love and time away from the harmful situation  my mom was a hoarder and i was living with her so cleaning doesn t take much out of me  but when i finally decided i needed to leave he moved me into his family home and bought me a sledgehammer to take to all of the piles of trash in my former home  this isn t an always thing  this is a now  while he s grieving and facing his own mortality thing 
for the sake of anonymity  i won t say  but it s a job where he mostly just puts in his headphones and does his job without talking to anyone  sometimes he ll just call me and say  tell me about your day   i catch him up on my day and then sometimes he just wants to listen to me go about my day while he works 
i have been for the past year or so  but it wasn t always like that 
right now  maybe not  but he s the only reason i am well enough to fight for him  because he fought for me first 
i m saving for a car but make enough to leave if i wanted  he just insists on taking care of me in that way  especially while i m going back to school 
yeah i m totally super selfish for trying everything i can to take care of him  for sure   
your hope is in the right place
nope  it s true off my chest  meaning i wanted to get something    off my chest  i tried to warn people that all of their assumptions and advice would be ignored  they just didn t listen  i wrote that paragraph because i d already gotten a hundred messages and comments telling me what to do and telling me that i m the bad guy here  so i wanted to try to see if people would actually read and stop trying to change my mind  obviously it didn t work
he doesn t want me to leave  he s just worried that i m unhappy  meanwhile  he s coming to me with baby names and videos talking about different parenting styles and ways we  have to do things differently so our babies to have to deal with this to    but sure  my relationship will fail because he s chronically ill and worried it s too much for me 
you are going to end up so burnt out and resent him eventually  you are not living 
i did not say she should leave him  neither in my response to you or my response to op  although him doing things for her doesn t mean she is obligated in any way to stay in a relationship   the biggest problem with what you said is the idea that if she leaves he may turn suicidal  he is the only one responsible for his actions  for choosing to do something about his depression or not as well as any behaviors he performs as a result of his mental health    do not ever tell someone or imply that they are responsible for or would be at fault for another person s choice to end their life  that is wildly incorrect and a very harmful message 
did you read her edit  apparently we re all trying to steal her dumpster fire and hits hers and we can t have it  no one could possibly understand their romeo and juliet love story as no one on planet earth has ever been in her shoes trying to heal someone who has no interest in being healed 
i am so sorry
awww thanks kind stranger  i m sooo much better  life doesn t all of a sudden turn into rainbows and jolly otters when you get sober  but it does make dealing with the downfalls of life significantly easier 
there s a lot of genuine advice here and you re responding like this to only one poster  you need to reflect properly or stop posting asking for validation only and kidding yourself that other people don t love their partners just because they won t sit watch and help them rot
you seem like you want to be validated in your opinion on the matter instead of actually wanting advice  you re now upset that we don t agree with you  your family and his family are absolutely right in this  i think you somehow thought you d come here and get validation for what you re doing but at this point you re doing absolutely nothing to help this man  if you love him like you say you do  then you ll walk away and force his hand to make those changes  you staying  well let s face it  will keep digging that hole for him  he doesn t have to do anything to change because he has you to compensate for him  stop 
it s the truth and you re being blind and foolish  he won t get better because you are enabling him  and you ll keep crying about how he s not getting better until it weighs you down enough that you stop caring for yourself  reality sucks sometimes  being ignorant sucks more 
oof  not good  he s got to  want  to get better if he s ever going to  op shouldn t set herself on fire to keep him warm 
u pitiful test     this is real  you will  or may already have  become a caretaker or mother to him instead of lover  in the past two years  how has your love life changed  obviously it will change after such a dramatic event  but how is it now  how many times does he reach out to  initiate a hug  to initiate a kiss  to initiate sex  what  does  he ask of you  what are you able to ask of  him     people who have told you  wake up  aren t doing so to be mean or heartless  they see a woman who has cared  who has done it all  the problem is that it has gone on  too long   mental health issues are real        but they re also our responsibility to address  which won t happen magically 
if you truly love him you need to stop enabling him   enabling is not support  it s literally the opposite   you re actively hurting him by doing all that shit for him 
you need to stop  because what you are doing isn t healthy for either of you  you re going to ruin your own relationship  because it s never going to be one if he won t step up  a relationship is one of partnership and caring  it can t be perpetually one sided   you re a caregiver  and you ll burn out and resent the situation or him    you have to let him manage on his own terms and see where that gets him 
he s content with you enabling him  the fact that he doesn t get help and you stay and continue you bend over backwards to take care of him are all you need to know about how he feels about you  if he really loved you the same way you loved him  he d meet you halfway and feel terrible for running you ragged  romantic love should  never  be unconditional  you re not fixing anything by doing all of this  you re making him worse  he s not motivated to change because you are just allowing him to mistreat and take advantage of you  he is mistreating and taking advantage of you  by the way if you weren t aware  like  egregiously    you have zero boundaries and he s walking all over you  tighten up and get a grip  it s cool to love someone and take care of them when you re also being poured into but the way you describe all you do for him absolutely reeks of desperation and low self worth  he s literally using you and giving you nothing in return 
so it s not just that he can t help himself  or doesn t have the ability to help himself  he is actively refusing to help himself    that is a new level of disdain  op  refusing to talk to you because you did all the hard work for him  and all he has to do is have a conversation  refusing to say a word to the therapist because his girlfriend dared try to do the one thing that is most likely to make his life better       you can lead a horse to water but you can t make him drink  the question you need to ask yourself is  are you okay with this dynamic continuing indefinitely   he seems to prefer to stew in his own misery  sometimes  rock bottom is what it takes to get someone off their ass  in this case  rock bottom might be his wonderful girlfriend leaving him after having gone above and beyond to make getting help easy for him  and only having him refuse her every effort 
you need to stop doing shit for him and tell him      he does his own laundry  or you wear dirty clothes      you go get groceries  or there will be no food     you get out of bed  or you miss work    start spending your evenings with family or friends  leave him to fend for himself    push the baby bird out of the fucking nest
this comment makes it sound like you re his mother 
the thing is  if you don t do everything for him  he d have no choice but to do it himself  or at least to do something for himself  this honestly isn t helping him     from the outside it does look like you enjoy him being reliant on you  but i know you said it s not that  so you re just letting him destroy both of you instead  why should he change when you ve set it up so he doesn t have to   stop enabling him 
this isn t a relationship 
no one s saying to do more  most are saying do less  or at least do differently   what you are doing isn t working and we are all a bit perplexed you don t see it 
hey it s ok  don t let the comments wind you up  there is something admirable about what you are doing for your partner   i m sure some people are projecting because there is some jealousy of how strong   seriously you re taking the relationship  which is not a knock on anyone  who wouldn t be jealous of a strong relationship   connection etc  that this appears to be     as blunt as the comments might be  the message is one you need to take a look at because  it isn t fair to you or the relationship  if he has to rely this heavily on you  because if it s not already  it will negatively affect the relationship to a point it can t come back from   i m sorry but it s been over   years  he can t expect someone to help him when he won t even help himself by talking to someone   by letting you behave like his parents and he s the toddler   you need to sit down and have a very honest   direct conversation about how it is affecting the relationship   how it makes you feel like he doesn t care about you  or your efforts or the relationship 
hon  i don t know your story or your details so this may be a miss  but there s something seriously fucked up with the relationship dynamic you re describing  and i think what alarms me the most is how you seem to think what s going on is somehow virtuous  that alone tells me you don t know what a healthy relationship looks like   from what i ve gathered  your bf  saved  you from a tough situation and then nursed you back to emotional health  healthy people look for other healthy people to date  if he was willing to take on a project like you were at the time  that s either a savior complex or someone who thinks only another broken person will accept them  either way  it s not healthy   and now you  saving  him is all of the dysfunction in reverse  and since it s been   years without getting any better  my bet is you ve stood in the way of his recovery with all of your  help   why would he try to get better when being a wounded bird means you ll do everything  life is hard  if i didn t care about my husband s wellbeing and he waited on me hand and foot for being  broken   i would fucking stay broken   you want to know what you can do for your bf  see a counselor  not him  you 
are you currently in therapy  what does your therapist say about this dynamic 
thanks for the info  are you willing to answer my first question  are you prepared for your life to be like this forever 
he seems lovely
so you just sat there while he waited on you hand   foot and magically you got better out of nowhere    no therapy  no medication  nothing but him doing everything for you  no work on your side whatsoever    stop being so na ve  you making excuses is just enabling him to do nothing about it    i m not saying you have to breakup but if he refuses to help himself nothing will change  except you getting dragged into your own depression 
all due respect you re focusing on the wrong part of what i said 
oh wait so you re basically using him as a meal ticket and transportation   hmmm interesting 
the fact that is the point you take from my comment is very telling  you are not selfish for being supportive  you are selfish for enabling his behaviour further crippling him and being too dense to see it  you have a very strange perspective on relationships  you have had to care for your mother and now your boyfriend  i think you strongly need to discuss in therapy your fixation on never giving up on people even when it significantly burns you out and leaves you mentally drained  you cannot help anyone while burning yourself
i don t think you re the bad guy and i m sorry people are making it seem like you are  i truly hope that you and your bf can work things out but i think you need to remember that you need to be taken care of as well  i think people are mostly worried that you ll burn yourself out and start resenting him or that you re kind of enabling him  love in the scenarios can only do so much after so long
oh that s what you mean     yeah      sorry    i actually didn t mean it like that      i just meant to say that leaving him won t make him better person   because few people commented that leaving him will make him a better person as he will start doing things for himself     i just wanted to say that it may backfire     sorry i actually didn t mean to say that she would be at fault      and thanks for telling me my mistake          
thank you   he was an amazing man but ptsd drove him to alcohol   he had so much more to offer but he didn t believe that 
no  i didn t come here for advice  i didn t come for validation  i came to get something off of my chest  instead  i have a bunch of people blaming me for everything and acting like i m hurting my boyfriend when i know i m not  at this point i don t care what people think of my relationship based on five paragraphs summing up the darker parts of four years 
op needs to get over the very immature belief that that love  her love  proven through selfless service   s  is a magic cure  if it hasn t worked yet then the cure is not effective 
so  fix the problem  but when i do everything you said it s making him worse 
whatever you say  i guess i ll just go throw away   years of love and devotion because redditors decide that my relationship isn t worth anything because my boyfriend is depressed 
i am one of the people telling her not to leave him  but that what she is doing is causing more harm to him  he is not healing  he is not healthy    if she wants to be a full time caregiver  cool  but that is not what is best for him  he needs help  what she is doing is not helpful  you cannot enable a person like this and improve their life  she is hobbling him 
i mean    codependent people do form close relationships  by definition  and it doesn t mean they re healthy    i know i haven t seen a single thing here that i would be jealous of   yikes  
this is exactly right  she sees herself as a hero but he is not savable in this messed up dynamic  he needs to make some effort  and she really needs therapy  this is a disaster 
he is   
how in the world is that what you got out of that  i m supporting him  he s supporting me how he can 
i kicked my own mother out of my life for using me  i know how to draw boundaries when i need them  and i know where the limit is  i chose the things i do for him very carefully  things like wearing clean clothes boosts confidence  eating good food boosts energy  and when i ask him to brush his teeth with me or shower with me  we have a sense of intimacy that not only keeps him hygienic  but allows him to be vulnerable with me  it s not like i m killing myself  these are all things i already did  i just do them a little more now to help him feel supported and loved  it s no skin off my back  i just get sad that he can t help himself right now   
it s hard seeing someone go through that  all i can say is i wish i could give you a hug  i had to watch a friend go through this  he was never the same coming back from iraq  i know it s not the same as a partner  and ptsd is just so hard on everyone  i worry many have it from the pandemic 
oh if you only read your comments and everything to your therapist  it is obviously you came for advice  your cross posted in advice channels  and you are seeking validation  you are not reading what people are telling you with an open mind  you are closing up and getting defensive  
nobody is  blaming you for everything   people are however sharing their similar lived experiences  the outcome of all of them are similar  the individual with the problem had no impetus to get better until they lost their safety net   you are taking those same outcomes as some sort of personal insult because they are the exact opposite of what you insist on doing   respectfully  i d suggest looking at why you feel so defensive in response to the overwhelming anecdotal evidence that when the supporting partner left  the troubled partner forced themselves to seek help   i have had a major depressive disorder cycle  the act of showering  getting out of bed  eating was way too much and overwhelming  but there was still something inside me that compelled me to seek help and fight to get better   not everyone has that  you did  your bf does not  no matter how much you love him  love is not always a magic wand  there is that old phrase if you love someone set them free   what you ve been doing hasn t been working  i would encourage to sit quietly and reflect on why  be brutally honest with yourself as you ponder why you doing absolutely everything hasn t worked  and then be brutally honest with yourself about how long you can keep this up  and how you really feel about the fact that your bf has done nothing to help himself   i m interested in what your therapist has said about this 
literally what is the point of posting here if you don t want opinions  i don t understand the purpose of this post  you put this out there  you re going to get comments about it  would have been easier to not post this at all  idk what you expected 
at this point how much of this is genuine depression and how much of it is weaponized incompetence    you need to stop doing so much for him  i bet he gets mad when mommy     stops doing everything for him 
uh  what   i didn t say to do anything except for  stop enabling him  as you re still doing that yes  it s making it worse    he needs to do shit for himself  frankly he d be better off without you 
it s sounds like it s not just people on the internet but people in your life  people that know you both and are more informed than redditors 
not telling you to throw it away  just telling you to stop cooking for him  doing his laundry  and waking him up for work  if you stop doing that  he will have to step up  if you keep doing these tasks for him  he will never have the desire to do them himself 
 redditors decide that my relationship isn t worth anything  no one said that 
  years of experience and learning things about yourself is not throwing it away if you break up  also  in the grand scheme of things    years is nothing    please read the other stories  you may very well love him to death 
i agree   writing a comment that comes at the issue in a different manner in which you wrote yours  doesn t mean i m disagreeing with you
it s called compassion dude  everyone else is just throwing aggressive comments at her  nothing wrong with trying a different approach to get the same message across
i m nobodies hero
you love and you know him the best  just make sure whatever decision you take  you have to live with the consequences  good or bad but hopefully good  not some randos on the internet who downvote everything 
 how in the world   same as how you don t understand there s no real love in this relationship  only codependency    it s ok  we all need character development  some hurt more than others  it all depends on when you choose to snap out of it  i just hope it s sooner rather than later  the regret that comes with a lot of years wasted is heavy 
i think you re a wonderful devoted girlfriend for doing all that you do  i m just worried that you might lose yourself in all of this because of your love and devotion to him  ive been in this position before where i thought i had a handle on things but then i look up and i m in a deep hole  i hope your bf makes a swift and consistent recovery but i just hope you look out for yourself as well    
this post is not cross posted anywhere  i had a post a few days ago looking for advice  this one was not  i am not seeking any validation 
idk maybe the name of this sub is true off my chest and i wanted to get something off my chest  just spitballing here
right  if people you know and people you don t know are all telling you the same thing it might be time to listen 
i don t think it s throwing away anything to break up  i think it s a huge betrayal to let someone help you get better only to leave them the second they re an  inconvenience   that would be a waste of   years 
yet you talk about sacrificing everything for him  you really need to talk to your therapist about this  this is super unhealthy 
you think from reading one post you can tell me that there s no love in my relationship  you have no room to tell me that based on a couple of paragraphs summing up   years of a loving relationship 
hun you are  it is obvious  you re young and have a die for my partner attitude
the big difference is    you were willing to change yourself and get better   he isn t   he s actively refusing to get better and perfectly happy to let you be his mommy  his servant  his organizer  his maid  etc  you re allowing him to remain in a situation where he can chose to not get better  he s taking advantage of your kindness  if he cared about you the way he claims  he d put in the effort to get better  but he s not    are you still seeing a therapist for yourself   if not  you need to 
i had the same mentality when i was younger  helped my ex escape an abusive step father and neglectful mother  a perverted grandfather  an abusive ex boyfriend  and there was always some form of drama in her family  i was always willing to throw whatever i was doing down and help her family     and what do i get in return  she cuts me off and starts dating a    year old  married  deadbeat felon  who s wife and step children live a block over  the oldest step daughter is only two years younger than my ex     that  put things into perspective for me

 they ve developed a plant based protein formula that s reportedly twice as effective as whey protein   i highly doubt this is possible  but i am gonna ask for a source anyway 
if you look at their investor deck  it shows their protein amino blend   is in the    s of the digestion scale   i think like    cals and you need like     grams of it
i know i was skeptical at first too  quote from their website   promino  and rejuvenate  utilize a patented formula from the university of arkansas  led by dr  robert wolfe and is the result of over usd     million in research over    years including extensive human clinical trials on muscle repair  recovery and muscle protein synthesis    ill also link their most recent investor presentation if you care to dig deeper    https   drinkpromino com promino  investorpresentation pdf  https   drinkpromino com promino investorpresentation pdf 
 when you eat protein  your body must first break it down to extract the   essential amino acids needed to repair and grow new muscle fibers  when taken as a supplement in the proven  precise ratio these free aminos are instantly absorbed into the bloodstream  without the digestive delay of conventional protein sources   made sense to me  but i m not a biologist  so  basically  this is not a vegan protein powders but vegan amino acid  all   in perfect ratio  powders  which is why they are better than whey proteins due to skipping the digestive delay 
how is this different than any other plant based bcaa supplement already on the market 
i am not a biologist  but from the contexts  i would surmise that bcaa is either not one of the   protein amino acids  or that bcaa is a part of the   protein amino acids but not all    all i could gather from their brochure was that this is vegan   amino acid powders  not vegan protein powders  with or without bcaa  
thanks for the reply  i m not a biologist either  but i know from my time as a gym rat that most rely on bcaas for muscle growth and recovery  and there are multiple established vegan options in the market already  but maybe like you said  this could be something more complete 
https   www ajinomoto com amino acids    amino acids  apparently  according to google  there are    amino acids  complete protein s   amino acids are called essential amino acids  and   of them are bcaas  but we need the other      total  for muscles 
personally  i think these are excellent questions   i m tired of watching things that compare anything to the standard american diet   it s time we all agree the sad is terrible and should be abandoned  for literally any other diet   i would love to see comparisons of various  good  diets   large clinical trial of vegan high fat vs vegan low fat would be amazing   for me  vegan keto has caused my ibs to virtually disappear  but i m a sample size of one  though happens to be the one that matters most to me     how about small things like vegan vs veggan   i m definitely done with the comparisons to the sad   if you re not an ethical vegan  seeing a large study comparing the different ways of doing keto would be very cool 
saturated fat raises ldl  bad  cholesterol  coconut and palm oils are full of saturated fat 
please stop keto   vegan yes but stop the keto  especially coconut oils are really bad  no matter what anyone tells you  i am a dietitian  vegan  but sometimes eat fat free dairy  and my blood work is great  i have very low ldl cholesterol and triglycerides  my hdl is great and my hb ac is nice and low as i eat low carb but not keto  i pair my carbs with a lot of fiber and eat mostly vegetables with a source of protein 
what i ve been reading for years is that ldl itself isn t bad  small ldl particles are bad  if saturated fat raises ldl but it s the large kind  that shouldn t be a problem   saying something is bad and therefore it causes problems isn t specific enough and risks throwing the baby out with the bath water  is ldl bad  we know for sure that ldl can be small and large  we know it serves a purpose in our body  it moves stuff around our body  when i go to quest to get the cardioiq lipid fractionation panel done  the results break the ldl into small  medium  large counts  plus the peak size  and all of those have dangerous high and low ranges  so quest labs  that does a ton of the blood tests for people in california at least  is aware that it s more complicated than ldl is bad   besides that  there s also tons of research saying that lp a  is actually the problem  drugs are being trialed and readied for market right now to lower that  and without doing a specialized test  lp a  is indistinguishable from ldl  so is lp a  the problem and all of the tests done on ldl were affected by lp a  and not actually the ldl  does saturated fat raise lp a   studies already show that it actually lowers it  which  if we want to jump to conclusions making assumptions about lp a   means people with high lp a  should be eating saturated fat   even ignoring saturated fat  cardiologists tend to put people on statins  but statins can do actually raise lp a   so what s worse for me  someone with heart disease  saturated fat or the statin recommended to me    also  i didn t ask about saturated fat  some lean chicken breast without the skin or some small amount of salmon is relatively low in saturated fat comparatively  and can be consumed while still following guidelines suggesting less than     or even    of calories come from saturated fat 
that s a weird comment to make on r veganketo  also  i m questioning the vegan part  not the keto  and you re telling me i m wrong and not addressing the why  which is what i was asking about  why should i be vegan  if people live for a long time and without heart disease in japan and with the inuit  and where are the studies showing vegan performs better than whole foods plant forward keto  or even just low carb  no processed  plant forward with hormone and naturally fed meat   i m on a statin  my hdl is finally in range        with fish oil supplementation  i ve been doing vegan keto with some meat for awhile and my cholesterol numbers are fantastic  to the point that i m worried they are too low   why is coconut oil so bad  from what i ve been reading  saturated fat isn t correlated with mortality  there are some studies that show some negative effects  but i can t find them right now and those negative effects aren t clogging the arteries  at least  not directly  cholesterol and calcium clog the arteries but cholesterol in your body doesn t  the type matters  small  malfunctioning  oxidized ldl particles and inflammation clog the arteries  so every study that says that saturated fat raises cholesterol is ignoring the fact that the type of cholesterol matters  most of them don t mention that   i ve been having around     of my daily calories from saturated fat  coconut milk and nuts  daily for months and my cholesterol markers are all fantastic  in my individual case  i m skeptical that coconut milk or saturated fat in moderation is a problem 
if you have heart disease you should be getting the opinion of a cardiologist and a dietician that works with them 
the replier may have not realised which sub they re on  i got this as a recommended post related to r shittyrestrictionfood and i assume that the person above got recommended due to being on r vegan or r askvegans or something 
one of the cardiologists i mentioned above  joel kahn  dean ornish or caldwell esselstyn  the ones who i don t understand how they are ignoring japan and the inuit with their statements   i m following my cardiologist s advice  i did the dean ornish program  i m not saying they re wrong or that everyone should go off all meds  i haven t gone off any meds   i m looking for answers to my questions above so i can understand why i m following my cardiologist s advice  the questions seem pretty simple and should have pretty simple answers   how does anyone know that vegan low fat is the best when they haven t done trials comparing vegan to other diets  and how can they ignore the fact that in japan and with the inuit  where they have extremely low heart disease rates  they eat meat

i called the site directly and got pre screened over the phone  i googled my local site and found their phone number that way  i have inquired about several trials and never received a call directly from the site since there s high demand   they were unfortunately full but put me on the wait list in case a spot opened in the future 
i m   week in on my reta trial  truimph    knee osteoarthritis  currently lost about    kg   i m in a  fb reta support page  which might  be good for you   https   www facebook com share cyfrculddrh hrl   mibextid k  xfp
i ll be honest  be annoying  call the site  see if they re enrolling  you gotta be proactive  it took me about   weeks to get in after did that for my trial  then it s usually   pre screening visits  blood work  signing consents  measurements etc etc  visit   then you get randomized and take your first dose  good luck  
definitely call the site  i called my site  got a call back that day  and had my intro appointment scheduled for   days later 
i applied yesterday for a reta trial and was contacted this morning for a next week start time  fingers crossed i get the real deal and not the placebo  they said it was a     chance i get the real thing and     the placebo 
https   www facebook com share cyfrculddrh hrl   mibextid k  xfp
i agree with the comments indicating you should call the site directly   i did that for a prior trial that had been full  but they kept me on a waiting list and called me directly about this trial   i never applied through the lily site

i welcome research funding but none of these will have a big impact  don t they know that thousands of us have already tested these 
pacing  strength training  melatonin and meds that keep you awake  what a joke    how about looking at and treating the source of our problems since there is so much evidence of viral persistence  dysregulated immune system and metabolic dysfunction 
already tried all this  doesnt work  move on to better options please
wish ron davis was getting the moonshot money  what an utter waste of money 
melatonin   fuckin melatonin and light therapy        i did that at first with cbti  it didn t do shit     took    mg of mirtazapine and     mg of indica rso oil to even touch it  with a stack of other things too and a diet change to fix my guts 
if they could identify biomarkers to screen for people with no pem who can safely exercise without significant risk of developing pem  that would be worthwhile 
the way to contact recover https   recovercovid org contact  please share your thoughts and concerns about these trials with them 
i take melatonin as one of a handful of supplements that i credit with allowing me to sleep through the night  but taking modafinil was an absolute disaster and left me a depressed  jittery  sleepless mess  i lost a lot of functioning on modafinil  and ultimately  finding a low level of exercise that existed within my moderate pacing needs  adding rest to my day  getting my hormones in order and taking famotidine  melatonin  and magnesium are the things that made rest possible again  before that i would just be under a dark blanket trembling and hoping for the best   hope this helps some people and starts to document what we already know through having lived it 
can someone explain what light therapy  melatonin and what with the people who stratet to take antidepressiva for sleep since    years  this shit is  also addictive and causes withdrawal even some permanent damage
it s downright harmful as it s taking away resources  researchers  time and money  from helpful research 
this isn t the moonshot money   
it is using different intensities of light to affect the circadian rhythm  these are different colors such as cool light in the mornings and warm light in the evenings 
yeah i know  but this is the crap they ll waste that on as well 
pretty crap isn t it 
dr  nath suggested the following treatments recently after presenting their findings on me cfs   lc     checkpoint inhibitors   anti cd      anti cd     btk inhibitors   mycophenylate   tacrolimus   jak stat inhibitors   il   blockers   il   antagonist   ivig   immunoadsorption  when he was asked by the audience when many of these trials would start  he said  i don t make funding decisions  but these should happen     i would encourage people to write to recover to sincerely rethink these trials  they do not align with the current research nor their own special groups researching lc   me cfs  this is embarrassing to say the least  especially compared to other groups like   https   www science org content article long covid trials aim clear lingering virus help patients need
these are the suggestions of an agency that doesn t want to deal with this problem  won t review existing literature  and is hesitant to spend any money to solve it  symptom management without understanding of root causes   the only thing that has touched my symptoms in   years of suffering is paxlovid  my hope is that more competent research programs will produce better results with antivirals  monoclonals  and immunotherapies 
i ve had three in lab sleep studies in the four years since i was diagnosed with long covid  the director of my sleep lab says she s never seen such an influx of new patients in all her decades working there  there has been an uptick of rem disorder diagnoses and she believes it s due to covid  people with rem disorders are     more likely to develop dementia than people without them    as part of my job  i regularly process death certificates and i d estimate at least     of them list dementia as a cause of  or contributing factor to  death    i can t believe so few people are concerned about this 
for those who want to know what the studies will explore the effectiveness of without reading the full article     modafanil and melatonin for sleep disturbance    cardiopulmonary rehab and basic exercise education for those experiencing exercise intolerance characterised by fatigue but do not experience pem  apparently they ll screen for pem and exclude anyone thought to have it     an intervention called  structured pacing  to support those who experience pem  will not include any physical exercise    i m a bit disappointed they re not exploring some exciting drug to treat pem  but i suppose nothing has enough of an evidence base as yet for them to take the gamble of focusing their efforts on    you d think maybe ldn  oh well  let s hope this structured pacing is better than  you know  the pacing we ve all been doing for years lol  got to start somewhere i suppose 
i have had covid for   years  the nih recruited me for a study  turns out i had covid too long and they wanted people with less than    month  smh 
i was part of recover early on  the first red flag was when they offered me an mri safe mask to replace the aura they asked me to remove while in the room with the mri and then never gave it to me  when i freaked out about it the tech was casually like  well its not mandatory   tf  why would i want a mask you ve breathed all over  then the second time i told them i was on a time constraint as i was working and i only had time to come  do the scan and leave  and they left me waiting over an hour and nearly refused to pay me  i had to raise hell  both times i raised hell  the people running the study don t even believe that covid exists themselves and if they do  they re ignoring it not doing enough to ensure the safety of participants    doing recover for that short time showed me that environments in which research studies exams take place are not as controlled as they would have you believe 
i can t find the article can anyone help
this is important research and good news for those of us who are dealing with the sleep deprivation issue  taking a handful of melatonin and a benadryl will guarantee a good night s sleep  and a drug hangover the next morning  it s one of the  hangers on  symptoms left over from a   year stint of long haul covid     i consider myself somewhat recovered  but it s all one day at a time  who knows what tomorrow will bring 
 removed 
it s like they re doing the bare minimum to make it look like they re trying so they can keep funding   
yeah this is not really gonna help anyone   people have tried all of these things  and sure they help to some extent  and validating that scientifically is not a bad thing  but beyond that it s really not gonna help understand lc and actually cure people 
wonder if the goal of the virus is to make everyone have dementia would be an easy way to slowly invade a country over      years lol    i for sure feel like i ve gotten dumber since getting the pfizer vaccine and covid especially with recall i used to have amazing memory both short and long term now i struggle to remember things i did the same day or previous day all the days feel jumbled  it also feels like everyone else has gotten much much dumber as well i also feel like i hear people wheezing and short of breath in conversation these are fit people     in all reality clots and microclots would for sure fuck up your brains functionality if a pipe is clogged or has holes leaking the flow of water will be disrupted aka our memories recall brain and body health
omfg  why can t they build on existing research from even over    years ago  me  and we might actually have a chance  in fact get all the biggies in one room  especially ron davis  and throw money at them n get this shit solved ffs  do none of them have brains      i m thick as mince  i m not really  and i come up with that within seconds  it has to be on purpose 
modafinil is a drug that make you awake not tired 
modafinil did nothing for me 
what an absolute joke
welp that s some on brand bad science for the nih    what a bummer 
recover through the chapter i m in has been really solid  sorry you such a bad experience  that s a bummer to hear

viruses aren t sentient  and they don t have goals other than infecting as many hosts as possible 
yeah the only reason they don t do this is because of deep institutional prejudice       like can they think they know better though  the arrogance and hubris is astounding 
its crazy
it s all about the money 
 it has to be on purpose  tbf it s not like they have total free rein  there s parameters they ll need to work within and they ll need to be able to justify their decision to focus on any specific drug or intervention  so it s not like they could do anything too off the wall  the catch    there is it means things don t get researched as they don t have sufficient evidence base  but then as a result they never get a sufficient evidence base to justify researching them lol  so it s less than ideal for sure  but i m not convinced it s deliberate institutional obstructionism  though that s not to say the nih doesn t have form for deliberate institutional obstructionism when it comes to me cfs in particular  just that that s not necessarily what s at play here     i m trying to stay optimistic about stuff  
yeah it s a bit unclear in the article  it says   a trial to test two drugs  modafinil and solriamfetol  approved by the food and drug administration to treat people who have problems staying awake during the day  known as hypersomnia  these medications are well known but have not been studied widely in people with long covid   and then goes on to talk about melatonin for lc insomnia  so maybe they d look at the other two to treat fatigue 
tried modafinil  kept me up for   hrs
yup
i think they meant it was a bioweapon 
pacing and melatonin  we ve doing this since the dark ages ffs  they clearly don t want it solved 
and the rabbit hole goes even deeper when you consider how much power and influence the psychiatric drug industry has  by psychologizing cfs  the market for antidepressants expands even further 
i have long covid and i took it  it doesn t really wake me up  it keeps me up but i am too tired to do anything and it feels like days are very short while taking it  i didn t like it 
   not safe
yeah  i m not entertaining such foolishness 
i am thinking the same  it was made in a lab 
how much mg melatonin do you take 
and exercise therapy even   gif  emote free emotes pack facepalm 
why do you believe that 
during my worst periods of insomnia    mg

it highly depends on your budget  many people can t afford the cost of a second therapist on top of ketamine  some people want their therapy sessions during a ketamine treatment  others want them in the days after a ketamine session because they are too woozy during the ketamine infusion itself  if the latter is true  don t want a separate therapist for that  and should they specialize in kap  or do you want your ketamine provider to also prove the therapist  there s no right or wrong answer as far as we know right now in which is better scientifically  so what provider you go with will highly depend on what you want   to me  it sounds like you want someone who will work with you during an actual infusion  provided by the same clinic as your ketamine  this will be very expensive and hard to find  but if you re gonna find it anywhere  it s definitely gonna be in california
tricky to choose  i opted for spravato because i wanted to avoid anesthesiologists being the providers  i d much rather have psych trained nurses administering my sessions for their experience and compassion  for iv ket  in my area  those locations are run by anesthesia professionals    sadly  the goal is money  not care  and i have absolutely had amazing care at the spravato clinic in my town 
very much agree  as a client  consumer   you have to decide what route you think would be most helpful for you  i can offer my experience with some different routes i ve taken  if that s helpful    i ve done im with no therapy   im and had therapy a half hour after   im and had therapy the next day   i am now doing oral ketamine     mg  with my therapist  so actual ketamine assisted therapy  kat  which is a three hour therapy session  i also still get im boosters    i ve found the oral ketamine in office with my therapist to be the most powerful in terms of gaining new insight  perspectives  and growth    the im boosters also serve a purpose  but it feels a lot more biological  in that it provides a relief from the depression and anxiety to a degree  i find i m less locked into black and white thinking  my mind is more flexible  which makes sense with neuroplasticity     when i started with ketamine it was just im  no therapy  and it helped me regain the ability to care again  i got some of my motivation and desire back to work on the deeper things  doing the low dose with my therapist  has made doing that work a lot easier i think   it feels like i am able to let my guard down more  be more receptive to new concepts perspectives  and those concepts tend to stick better    basically you have to decide on what you think will work best for you  and then you can narrow down criteria  a therapist who is offering kat should be able to share about their training and experience  many will have taken part in ketamine treatments as part of their training  some training by a are a weekend  some are months long   have studied harm reduction in psychedelic medicine  and ideally work in a modality you resonate with     i always have to remind myself that i m a consumer in the end  we get to ask questions to ensure we get the care we need  and a good provider will be able and happy to answer them  and even admit if they don t have an answer    last piece  if you go the therapeutic route  having a solid rapport and trust has been shown over and over to be the most important factor in a successful therapeutic relationship  it took a while for me to start doing the oral ketamine with my therapist  and i m glad it did because there is a solid foundation to work with    good luck 
thanks for your reply    i don t need therapy during the session but i do want someone trained as more than a trip sitter who can monitor me during the session  i expect that integration will take place a day or two after each infusion   the costs i ve been quoted so far top out at    k for six sessions and all of the pre and post therapy  intake  prep  infusion  integration  but most are around       k    i m fine with a therapist that s separate  i m finding a lot of that  it was suggested i look at psychology today for therapists who do this and several list kat and say something like   i work with xyz clinic to provide dosing  choice of type of ketamine and medical prescreening   there are of course psychiatrists who can prescribe but those individuals  at least as far as i ve seen  don t offer a lot of talk afterwards    my biggest fear is that i do this and i am worse off  i read  how to change your mind  years ago and what pollan said then still seems to ring true in the research and anecdotal evidence i ve read  when you start off in a vulnerable place psychologically  the therapy you get around any psychedelic used as a treatment for a diagnosis like mine is fundamental to the process  and also tripping completely alone or worse  with someone who doesn t know how to redirect or stop the session if it goes poorly is a bad idea for someone like me    that s why i want to ask good questions in advance 
thanks for your reply  your experience is valuable    allowing existing therapy to work is vital  my current therapist just had  the talk  i dread with me  which is the  i m not sure i can help you   she feels that there is some part of me  in the ifs sense  resistant to the emdr  this has happened to me a few times in the past when i ve gone deep into hopelessness  i get it  if you see someone regularly declining you will admit at some point it s not working  conversely  as a patient  the low point is where that is hardest to hear because i already have deep worries that i am just broken and nothing will help    ideally i want to choose whichever has the most potential to work for me and has the best guardrails against making my condition worse  to me that is at least having psychologically trained in session with me even if it s just to observe that i don t go wrong   edit  i agree hugely with the consumer points you made  i have been a caregiver medical advocate for several relatives and the choice of medical providers has literally been the difference between life and death    i feel the same about choosing this practitioner  i just don t feel like i know how to discern well so i want to ask those with more experience what questions i should ask  if this was a physical ailment i have more than enough experience  but in that case you have time to evaluate a treatment as it goes along    this is a little more like a cancer treatment plan   having been thorough that a few times with family  you have to choose the best you can and go with it  often from providers who have substantive differences in the way they think you need to be treated  time matters  in some sense you can t go back  you may get a chance to redirect but you may be worse before you re better  obviously cancer s stakes are different and there are points of no return with them more than this  but it feels like a similar requirement of the choice up front being the most important 
i definitely understand where you are at  i had a very similar talk with my therapist  and that is what ended up pushing me to connect with a kat trained person  it didn t feel great at the time  but i m so grateful for the push because my new therapist has a solid fit and really helped me grow    there are kind of two models when it comes to kat  generally speaking   practices that have everything in house  so psychiatrists  therapists  even in these settings if the psychiatrist offers talk therapy it s often way more expensive then seeing a therapist in the same place   and therapists who partner with an outside psychiatrist to offer kat    most therapists that do kat will have partnered with a local psychiatrist  who will complete an intake with you and prescribe the medication  i had to pay the psychiatrist for my eval but my therapist took     bucks a week off her bill so that in the end it was covered   the cost for the medication isn t absurd  i get ten    mg troches for      shipping with ice pack included   different therapists might have other arrangements if they are working in house with a psychiatrist for example  but it s more common to see them partnered with someone outside their own practice  don t let that scare you off    if there isn t a doctor on site for your kat  the medication will be sent to your house  and generally you sign an agreement stating that they are prescribed to be utilized with your therapist  you bring your meds to the therapy session  and at no point will your therapist touch them  out of their scope of practice   my therapist monitors my bp and heart rate at the beginning and end  generally ketamine is a pretty safe medication  and the initial evaluation with the psychiatrist will help ensure it s a good fit for you    i get your concern about set and setting  and the worry it could make things worse   i ve had some real big upsets during my treatment  including losing two friends in a month  i was really worried my im would be a disaster but it ended up being really helpful  lots of tears and grief  normal emotions to have  and then i had therapy after which really helped me process things    it sounds like you know you want to be doing the medication with a therapist  some questions i would ask   what kind of training have you had in kat   have you experienced the medications effects yourself   when was your last training   how long have you been practicing kat  do you have a good relationship with the prescriber psychiatrist   do you collaborate well together   what does an average session look like  what do you do if someone panics   how do you reduce harm in your practice  and help ensure safety   what modalities are you trained in  ifs  cbt etc   and which do you find most valuable while doing kat    a lot of kat therapists will have done some studying training with maps or be associated with appa  you can ask if they are familiar with either    finding the right practitioner is really important  it s great you are digging into things so that you can find the best fit for your needs  if you want to chat or have other questions feel free to send me a message or respond here   i kind of stumbled my way into great care honestly   so there was some luck going but i ve also learned a lot these past   months or so 
thank you very much  those questions you wrote out along with your experience was really helpful    unfortunately it s not the first time i ve been passed off by a therapist  i intellectually understand the reasoning and the ethical requirement to do this but  in my state  hearing this only feeds my fears that i am beyond help 
it s hard to have hope when everything is incredibly dark  and i still very clearly remember feeling like i was beyond help  i told my partner in september i would try  one more time  just once more  i started the im ketamine in october  no therapy  that helped get me to a place where i was able to have a some hope  desperately needed hope  i finally started with a new therapist in december i think it was  don t overthink this too hard for now  try some infusions at a solid clinic  and give yourself another chance    it s so hard to navigate mental health care when you feel like utter crap and have zero hope things will ever really get better  it can though  it isn t easy but you aren t beyond help  just posting here to see what options you might have and how to navigate them is a huge thing to do  cling to the little ember of hope that got you to post and the curiosity that maybe  just maybe  you aren t beyond help 
oof  i did not realize how far out in the tall grass this sub would be  gonna have to unsubscribe  good luck out there

every life is precious and endangering the well being of citizens for the efficacity of an experimental drug is the complete opposite of what medicine is all about   pfizer and moderna have racked billions of dollars in sales and stock profits by literally experimenting with people  the life of this young man is worth more than all of pfizer market capitalization  the fact that no one  cared to even mention the kid that just   died   in the article says everything that needs to be said about many people psychy   a young man just died         nothing political in my stance   i am serious about what i do and the stance that i take   no corporations gets the benefit of the doubt no matter the   good intentions    secondly  i do not sell any product nor ask for payment  nor advise anyone to buy or sell shares   i am creating a platform that can challenge the accepted narrative and enable open debates as long as it is respectful and structured   this is not a cult  you are welcome to disagree with my takes as long as you can lay down some arguments    thank you for your understanding 
fuckin  seriously  this post reeks of  anti vaxx  bullshit 
ya i have to agree  some useful posts here but yikes  unsubscribing as well 
is the person who posted this the guy we are supposed to trust with our money   he seems like a scammer himself if this is how delusional he is 
i m out  sad this thing had potential    the op reeks of a scammer himself now
you are aware the life expectancy of someone with dmd is like    max  right  the kid was very sick to start with which is why you sign up for a clinical trial  you accept the risk of potential death  it sucks but isn t super uncommon in clinical trials  especially for treatments for fatal diseases as it is 
you may be right  but i still consider it unethical to experiment with new drugs on people  especially mrna drugs that have clearly demonstrated their limitations in recent years  people close to me are still experiencing the after effects of the pfizer covid    vaccine  i simply don t trust pfizer or moderna 
totally within your rights to not trust something  do you re own research  but how do you expect us to progress our knowledge of medicine and treatments of diseases without testing them beforehand  would you prefer there to just be no medicines 
mrna have consistently failed since the   s and were forbidden until covid came along and pfizer literally   bribed  fauci with millions of         it is a money hustle    look at all the commercials on tv  most of them are pharma   in most advanced countries in europe  pharmaceuticals are not allowed to be commercialized    the biotech lobby is bigger than the oil lobby in the usa meanwhile we are the most obese  sickly  and drugged people on earth   these people keep us sick for profit    once again  not a conspiracy but simple evidence    the last   years really opened my eyes

not answering my question at all  i asked how do you propose that we create and develop medicines since you said you were against testing them on humans 
i don t claim to have all the answers on the issue but clearly  nutrition causes     of our health problems   ultra processed food  added sugar  high carb  chemically enhanced feeds and all sorts of assortments is the main problem  drugs are a mere patch    you want to fix the problem you deal with the root cause  which means that the biotech food industrial complex would have to crater like a sand pyramid   personal experience here    i have lost   lbs on intermittent fasting low carb diet in   year  and i was somewhat fit not even obese   i used to get headaches  cold  mood swings  and i was a sugar addict   all gone within a few months    no drugs  no pills    for the special cases drug might help  but drugs and pills are not the solution for an endemic issue 
again not answering the question  no shit losing weight is a good thing  and i m not disagreeing with your stance on processed foods  general health started to decline once we started putting everything in plastic bc of the war   i m asking you how do you propose we develop medicines if we can t test them on humans  that was what your big issue was with  vaccines are a wonderful thing and have saved millions of lives thru time  i m not saying there may not be issues with new tech but i m saying there is a method to the madness 
vaccines are a good thing  the vaccine   industrial complex   is not    the agro biotech corps have a bigger lobby than even the military and oil    the whole healthcare system is bought out by big pharma and the results speak for themselves    when is the last groundbreaking vaccine to date btw    probably a century ago 
this conversation is pointless if you won t answer the question  quit moving the goal posts here  you know your argument is baseless  move along  have a good day 
dr peter mccollough  i listen to people way smarter than me and i do not try to win pointless argument based on faulty logic    big pharma is it for profiteering not curing   the last vaccine breakthrough was about a century ago     https   x com vigilantfox status                     s    t qmhdrqicdbp  pqjkb xfg
i m sorry but wtf are you not understanding  i clearly  about   times now  have asked about your comment on not testing medicines on humans  i asked how you propose how we develop and test new medications then if not on humans  if you can t answer this  this again  everything else you have posted is complete and utterly useless 
bro are you   year old or what   the world isn t black and white and there is a certain degree of ambivalence that must be taken into consideration  but to systematically use humans are guinea pigs for corporate profit is insane and sickening when     of the vaccines are useless at best and the society just gets sicker    if you can t get that and want to absolutely win   the argument   please have it your way    that s enough for me 
it s not about winning an argument  i said previously i agreed with you about the monetization of it being wrong  i asked you how you propose we create medicines after you said you believed testing on humans isn t right  so how would we  and     is quite possibly the dumbest shit i ve read on reddit in a long  long time  you can t say you are about helping people stay healthy but not testing on humans to further develop the science of medicine  do you realize how fucking stupid that is  do you mean to tell me you d rather take a drug or vaccine that has only been tested in mice  or not tested at all  you realize how insane that is  right  i mean for fuck sake they shut down studies all the time when there are bad side effects  people don t realize how regulated pharmaceuticals is until you work for them  you don t dot an  i  or cross a  t  somewhere in your work  it can cost the company millions  everyone should have a right to take or refuse anything but to say testing on people is wrong is just fucking stupid  there is literally no alternative  it s that or let the common cold or flu start killing people and kids and let natural selection take control  let s get small pox going again while we are at it since vaccines only work     of the time  what a fucking moronic thing to say 
bro  cut the crap    you do realize that what you call   drugs  is simply natural herbal medicine that you can purchase at a pennie compared to the mark ups sold to you by big pharma  there is very little concern with   health  and  care  in the pharma world    once again you display a serious lack of deep thinking    only a fool will absolutely refute the need for human subjects in some experiments  and  unlike you  i do not speak in absolutes   but to make it a business model and to lobby governments like pfizer and moderna have done is beyond criminality   the corruption is systemic in the healthcare industry  it is a cartel arrangement and the quality of the service it provides speaks for itself   with the trillions of     spent on healthcare in the us  why do you explain the disparity between usa citizens rates of obesity  drug abuses  and others ailments with most advanced societies that do not spent nearly as much as us   that s the core issue i am trying to raise here brother  not some bullshit back and forth about human experiments    where does all that money go if people are getting sicker and sicker  fatter and fatter and families getting bankrupted because they can t afford their medical bills and have to travel to mexico for surgery    since you are a   years old  let me state it clearly for you    indeed we do need some experimenting  but the last vaccine breakthrough was     years ago    what does that say about the trillion dollars drugs vaccine industry    it is a scam  like the financial industry  the military industrial complex  the big agricultural industrial complex  the oil cartel etc  and i am a libertarian btw  cartels do more harm that plain old socialism  at least in socialism we all get the same crappy quality of services and goods    with that said  i am done arguing with you    if dr peter mccollough can t convince you on the criminality of the vaccine industry  especially with the covid    hysteria scam  then little old me can t and i won t try to force feed it to you 
saying i lack deep thinking while you reply like this is fucking comical  we are about   replies deep and you still can t answer the question i originally asked you lol what a fucking clown  the more i read from you the more i understand you just don t grasp the concept of how things work  ignorance is bliss i guess  i m done  enjoy your day  glad to know the small pox vaccine was growing on a vine somewhere lol ffs  i do not speak in absolutes  lol you don t speak anything coherently my dude   the covid shit was fucked the min it was made political and a requirement in some places  i m against that but at the same time  something has to be done to protect people when they aren t smart enough to protect themselves  hell people bitched about wearing a mask and that was more effective and preventing spread than just about anything  but that s another debate   we agree on lots of subjects  the basis of most of the problems in today s society is corporate greed and profit margins  it s not just pharmaceuticals  it s everywhere    but again that was not the point of this discussion  you seem to be missing that  it started with your first comment on human testing  i simply asked how your proposed to move medicines forward without them  we don t live in a perfect world where medicines aren t a need  do you say just let people get sick and if you make it  you got lucky  or what  tell me how you see it  and seriously  if you can t answer that  then stfu and move along bc we are achieving nothing by talking about completely different things    either answer the question and stay on topic or go away   edit to add  the last vaccine breakthrough was over     years ago     are you that fucking stupid  educate yourself bro  hell hepatitis b got licensed in       you crumble your own argument the more you speak lol
brother   you are probably too smart for me  want to argue with equal intellect  why don t you argue your case against the likes of dr peter mccullough  and dr john campbell    you buy your drugs and trust big pharma  meanwhile  i eat my greens and take my herbal supplements 
btw  did you let these people stick that covid    vaccine needle in you  i didn t and i am doing just fine  i thought we were all supposed to die if we didn t 
nobody said i trust big pharma  i just don t think it s a conspiracy like yourself  i work in medicine development  it s extremely hard to create something that s a wonder drug  it s why every single pamphlet for a medicine tells you it s prescribed bc the benefits outweigh the side effects  so you take herbal supplements  you know those are processed as well  correct  lol a bit hypocritical eh  lol
i did get mine and i m doing just fine  see  for someone that doesn t speak in absolutes  your words  not mine   you sure are implying the vaccine was an  absolute   don t get it and die   i mean you can t be that ignorant or much of a hypocrite can you  i mean hell dude not a single person said if you didn t get it to at you d die  not one  ignorant people took  increased chance  to mean certain death  only a moron would think that  again  it was doomed from the start bc it was made political  you think masks are insane and don t work either don t ya lol or is that another century old breakthrough too lol    truth be told i had family members get it and not  one passed away  one got long covid that triggered alzheimer s  one almost died in the hospital from it  there is no rhyme or reason to getting it or how it effects you  the vaccine was merely a necessity at the time since it was something that was extremely contagious that had no know treatments at the time  had we a treatment and it wasn t killing people at such a high rate  the vaccine would be treated like the flu vaccine  optional and recommended for high risk people 
there are no magic pills and things are complex  i am not conspiratorial by any means   just because you work in the industry doesn t mean much  you are just a professional  not one of the guy pushing the policies  that what lobbying is all about    supplements  herbs  nutritions  even some   drugs  are necessary    my  beef  is the cartel arrangements in our various industries  that actually harm innovation as you stated yourself  the complexity of the regulations is designed to prevent innovation and keep smaller players from toppling the big corps    if the horse buggy manufacturers of the   th century had as much pull in congress as today s big corps  we might still be riding on horse carriages  and  dead horse cleaning may still be a viable industry minting millionnaires    i am not against innovation  i am against   capture  via cartels and lobbying    the same thing is evident in the financial sector  oil  agriculture  media  military  even in sports    ok that s my last 
they threatened people  i know many people who lost their jobs for refusing to get vaccinated  the whole thing was a manufactured hysteria from which we are still trying to exit out of    don t be a hypocrite on this one 
you keep saying this over and over  and i ve agreed with you  the greed aspect is terrible  i could tell you numbers that would make you feel even worse lol    can you answer my question about why you think human testing is bad and how you propose we avoid it 
who is a hypocrite  i clearly said i was against forcing people to get it and that making it political was horrible  it wasn t manufactured hysteria though  what happened was real  and bc people wouldn t wear and mask and use common sense  millions of people died that shouldn t have  there does come a time when the government has to step in and help people get out of their own way  should driving while being drunk not be illegal  it s the same concept

i understand why you re saying that this could be research  but i feel what you re doing leans more clinical  clinical research includes people with clinical roles and research roles  and because you re not really doing the research roles  data analysis  drawing trends  writing up manuscripts   i d say this is clinical  patient interaction  charting  documentation

i ve tried that and it made it     times worse for me  i d rather just do it with cold water as fast as possible
what i do is probably not advisable but i take my first dose almost like a tequila shot with a cherry tomato with a dash of salt       
i just drink it straight  it s not that bad 
i ve been on xywav for a little over   years now  i ll be honest  i ve gotten completely used to the taste to the point that i don t even mind it anymore  it s not that bad imo 
same  mind over matter until i got used to it for xyrem and xywav has a sweet taste that wasn t an issue at all

please flair this post as solved   in the future  please do not type in all caps  all caps is more difficult for everybody to read  more importantly  for some users who rely on screenreaders it may be impossible because some screenreaders default to reading text in all caps letter by letter  it is always better  wherever you are on the internet  to just type normally  in mixed case 
doesn t it say in the rules once someone solves your post  to type  solved solved solved  in all caps 
 no  it does not   https   old reddit com r whatsthatbook comments    xp n updated rules post   it does say you should flair your own post and it does give instructions on how to do so  but those instructions are not in all caps   here is the relevant text     solved posts should be marked as solved  you can flair your own post as solved by commenting  solved solved solved  on the post  if you see someone else s post is not flaired as solved  you can report it and a moderator will flair it   however  it s worth noting that you don t need to flair your post using this method  you can flair your post by clicking the link marked  flair  under your post

that is a link to a post you made two hours ago  along with quoted text from    i don t know  maybe the automod  if i had to guess i d say that different messages from the automod and in the rules post were updated at different times and haven t all been synched up with each other properly   for example  in that quoted text they suggest reposting every two weeks  but every time i ve seen the mods come down on somebody for posting too often they suggest once a week   regardless  you can flair your post as solved by typing the phrase  solved solved solved  in all lowercase  it is not necessary to type it in all caps  you can try this out for yourself on your next post  and you seem to have flaired your post in the other way  which is also great  if you have any other questions about how to flair your post as solved you can contact the mods 
cool  i was just thinking it s good to make an edit on the rules about how not to listen to the auto mod so it s clearer that all caps are not good to have on the thread  thanks 
it s better not to have all caps on the internet at all  this isn t a reddit only thing    i know it seems strange to think that screenreaders work this way   i double check it every few months because i just can t quite believe it myself  but it does seem to be the case that this is how they re designed  and there may be good reasons for that  even without the screen reader issue  though  there would still be the fact that text in all caps presents a small but real difficulty in reading for people with trouble distinguishing between similar letters   for example  people with dyslexia or certain vision problems   as for your comment about ignoring the auto mod i think you know perfectly well that i didn t say anything of the sort  the auto mod message does not say that you must use all caps  it simply has that text written in all caps  most likely in a misguided attempt to draw attention to it  i don t really know why you re trying to start a fight with me over this  but i don t think it s fair for you to do that on somebody else s post in this way 
i was honestly just trying to clarify because i was confused  i ve never thought about it that way and i ve never posted before so the guidelines and standards for posting were not clear  i m sorry you thought i was trying to pick a fight  which was never my intention  in fact  i m glad you were able to take time out of your day to help clarify the situation  which seems to have many different messages  i don t even know the proper protocol to ask these questions  so i m sorry i didn t know that you weren t allowed to ask for clarification on someone else s post  or that it was unfair  thank you for taking the time to answer  although i am saddened that you interpreted my questions as aggression  i ll delete my comments if that will help  but i mean it genuinely when i say i don t know if that will be helpful or not  i would like your opinion on it  thanks 
well  i m sorry i misjudged you     i just take accessibility seriously  of course  i do know lots of people don t know that about all caps  and i wouldn t expect them to if it s never come up in their lives before 
thank you for the apology  i appreciate the sincerity and the good faith  accessibility is so important  it s actually really great to bring it to people s attention  i know i ll keep it in mind now  i just was confused by the auto mod message  in an effort to show my own good faith  though i hate to be a broken record   would it be more helpful and appropriate to delete my comments along this thread    
nah  but we really should stop pestering the op  if we have anything important to talk about we can pm   but  uh  although i make that offer honestly i actually hate pms  they trigger a huge anxiety response  i do not know why  so please  only if it really is important  not just to say  got it  thanks   or the like 
the possible implications for transplant recipients are     horrifying 
too bad doctors don t believe in long covid
great  another way for use to be screwed 
from the headline i thought this article was going to be about the impact of covid on surgeons and their ability to their jobs    love the recommendation to go to a lc clinic before surgery as if doctors know what to do to  cure  lc   
every article like this is just like      and then we keep infecting every person  x a year with no treatment or real vaccine in sight 
while they re in there cutting and slicing is a perfect time to get some tests for the live virus in various tissues 
not good  i hope we can hear more of further studies 
at least someone believes in long covid clinics  i just wish it was the patients 
fascinating
 removed 
 removed 
especially when hospitals don t have mask protocols
i believe that people have already gotten infected organs and some have died   it s a nightmare  we re living a nightmare
not least because they have to take immunosuppressing drugs 
bro you can t link to a study done before covid existed to prove your point about covid  covid is still relatively new in terms of how much is known as it s still being researched but it s pretty rash behavior to just label it as acting in the exact same way as other viruses
why  covid isn t seasonal  it s always present  there are zero signs that people are getting it less and developing meaningful immunity to reinfection  covid is more contagious than influenza  you are engaging in wishful thinking 
can you provide a source for any of these claims 
tell that to my friend whose life has been destroyed by long covid
adults on average get influenza once a decade  adults get covid twice a year  even if the risk was the same  do the math 
covid is a chronic infection   f off with your misinformation 
it doesn t have to be new to be a serious problem   because practically everyone has gotten covid  and will continue getting it over and over again very frequently      times per year   there s overwhelmingly more post viral covid than post viral anything else     a small percentage of an enormously large number is still a large number 
or screening protocols  can you imagine getting long covid because you needed an organ transplant 
i meant in terms of viral reservoirs   if millions of people now have virus laden organs  either they need to be screened for it and the donor pool for  everything  has shrunk dramatically  or failing to screen them now carries even greater risk for recipients 
this reminds me so much of the early hiv aids epidemic and blood transfusions 
right  so it s a double whammy   not only are they now significantly immunocompromised for life  they may have sars cov   lurking in their newly installed organ 
yes  i have lost everything myself due to this  and suffer all day and night  it s so painful i can only sleep     hours at a time 
 removed 
the parallels are terrifying
it would probably be best to avoid having viruses establish reservoirs in people s bodies  hiv has been managed well  perhaps we need to do the same for sars cov   
it is not the same as from those other illnesses  you know little of what you are speaking about

someone high up at nih verified that they had found evidence of a reservoir in an interview last week 
my tumor was similar  t n   about  cm  the margin of what they removed just crossed midline though the tumor didn t   i elected not to join a neoadjuvant trial and went right to surgery  a big part of why is that they said they would not reduce how much tongue they took  with the trial i was looking at  which was immuno chemo or dual immuno  not rt  and my tumor was really fast growing and had a big extra growth that was filling up my mouth  i could barely eat before surgery  i d been on a liquid diet for   weeks and even that was becoming impossible    my surgery was in june       as for how i m doing  no recurrence yet in the mouth but i have mets to lungs that are so far responding to immune therapy  pembrolizumab cetuximab  but it s early days  other than that i am dealing with a pile of side effects i have a peg because i lost my swallow to surgery  it came back  work in progress  but i ve had other messy side effects that slowed me down  a fistula and now a broken jaw due to osteoradionecrosis  
i m very sorry y all are going through this  i was t n m  and hpv negative  i believe my tumor was  cm  originally they thought it would only require about    th tongue removal  but it ended up being poorly differentiated bigger than they originally thought  and they took a little over half with razor thin margins  they did surgery first then    rounds of radiation     rounds of cisplatin  first off  i am fine  i was diagnosed almost    years ago at    yo  and after a really shitty   months my life went relatively back to normal and i have had a very successful career and great family  despite the speech impediment   people sometimes have trouble understanding me but it s ok    when i was diagnosed  a friend introduced me to another girl who was also diagnosed in her early   s   her case sounded more like you  except the cancer had broken out of the lymph nodes  i don t remember the medical term   she had chemo first to shrink the tumor  then surgery and radiation  the chemo was very effective and she ended up with maybe     of her tongue removed  with no reconstruction   she s still alive    unfortunately every case is unique and i have been in contact with other survivors who did not make it despite better odds  just make sure you get her in with a very good hospital   that seems to make the biggest impact    please feel free to pm me 
i had a t a pn  hpv   tumor was     x     x     with a   mm depth of invasion  i had a hemiglossectomy and neck dissection in early dec    and finished chemoradiation early march     i have my next scan in   weeks  but haven t had a recurrence as of yet  i have a peg tube that i m still on  multiple swallowing challenges  but otherwise would say i m doing pretty well  it s overwhelming and my life doesn t look like what i thought it would  but it s good    i had a lot of pain and swallowing difficulties leading up to surgery  surgery took care of the pain i was in  healing has its own pain  but it was nothing compared to being in pain   x      there definitely is hope but it s a fight  surgery is difficult  hated the trach  and chemoradiation was hell  but i started feeling better about   weeks after and notice improvements all the time  my radiation oncologist reminded me that healing can take up to two years  so improvement is still possible    support groups was my number one thing  i joined one of fb  before i found this forum  and i loved being able to ask random questions as they came up    let me know if i can answer any specific questions you may have 
i am so sorry for your sister  your post says a lot about you  she will need you  support by my friends and family was my savior in my biggest life challenge thus far    i love that they are leading with non surgical solutions first   not a doctor and just basing this on my own experience but if you are going to get zapped anyway  starting with it vs surgery makes sense to me    my two cents and it comes from a place of kindness  my experience  and consultation s from multiple oncologists before choosing my own doctor treatment     feel free to dm me anytime 
anyone familiar with vitamin b    amygdalin  laetril 
thank you for sharing that  i ve actually read a bunch of your comments here and the other sub i think  i recognize your username because i saw that you had a similar staging    it seems like so often with hnc once you ve dealt with one thing  other things pile up  it s cruel to me  but someone in here somewhere said something that resonated with me  something to about being on the right side of the dirt    to be honest  your story has given me hope despite all that you are still dealing with  i hope you kick its ass  truly 
thank you for this  i ve come to understand that despite the diagnosis the treatment often works  and sometimes it doesn t  she s at ucsd and although not one of the top places  i hope it s a good enough one  at least it s a national cancer institute from what i ve read    i ve seen here over and over how your care team makes such a difference  what s hardest is the vacillating between being hopeful and staying realistic but forcing yourself to take one day at a time    she s in so much pain and she s scared  she hasn t said it but i hear it when communicating with her  her biggest issue was pain management and she was struggling so much with that that she didn t have a lot of time or head space for other stuff  now she s struggling with her airway and her biggest worry about not being able to talk after recovering from surgery  my sister is super smart and she is a heavy researcher of everything and she hasn t done much research or reading since diagnosis about this  i m doing it for her  i can imagine a lot of different reasons why she hasn t and all of them break my heart a little  but i ll do it for her  i don t even think she is aware of how the staging for oral cancer works and i know she hasn t deep dived her my chart like i have  she s dealing with a lot already and this all happened so suddenly  early april was her birthday  she was fine  didn t feel well  and went to urgent care three days later  ct scan then biopsy the next day and three more days and got results  her world turned upside down so fast    i m very far away and that kills me  i m going in the next few days to be there for as long as i can  then back and forth  i m sure once i m there i ll have a better handle on what is happening with her   to just be there for her    this is horrendous disease just freaking awful  all of you who have been through this or are going through this are fucking brave hero s  for real  i have no words for how strong you all are  thank you for giving me hope 
thank you for this  your two cents is worth a whole lot  i think i get what you mean about being zapped first  after reading so much here and elsewhere it seems to make sense to me too  i m sure i ll be in touch  thank you for being willing to chat 
my husband was diagnosed as well  although at the time it was stage   throat cancer  is all they called it   it had gone to his lymph nodes   he s had it return twice  dealing with the third time now   to say this is a cruel version of a horrible disease is an understatement   i am so sorry your sister is going through this   all of you going through this are some strong ass warriors   my husband is my hero  dealing with this so humbly and with grace   he also did not research much about this   i did it   i am his person   i stand between him  his fears  the doctors  the bills  the treatment  the feeding tubes  the nasty ensure  the truth  the soft food diet  the meds  and all these tiny things   i stood up for him this last time  and reminded him that he had a choice  and his choice is all that matters  and i would make it happen   i swore in the beginning i would never make a promise i couldn t keep  and so far that has been the case   she doesn t have to research  she s living it   word of caution  the internet puts the worst nastiness answers up first to all your questions   do not put much stock in it   i quit googling about it years ago   i learned what my husband needed by being with him and dealing with his cancer   be her person   her job is to get better and get through treatments and surgery   be her person one day  one question  one problem  or request at a time   you do the rest   you are doing great   she sees what you are doing   peace and comfort to you  your sister  and all of you fighting every day   cancer sucks 
praying and wishing you well   dad has his staging for tongue cancer today   wish i could hug everyone going through this   i feel like she s my sister as well right now   something about shared pain that brings us together   with you in spirit if not in person   ali

earnings are     fyi
i d be interested in a feature length version of safe haven  so good
hail ratma 
when it comes to the segments in the v h s movies that are actually really good  i count my blessings that what we got was as good as it was  i m a bit hesitant to call for a feature length version of any of the good segments  because amateur night got that treatment with the movie siren  which i thought was terrible  slumber party alien abduction also got adapted into kids vs  aliens  and i haven t seen that 
yeah fair point  a lot of these are probably better as shorter  more focused segments
i might be in the minority here  but i quite liked siren lol  idk if i would go so far to say it s better than amateur night  but it was fun it its own way  you re probably right about safe haven  though   which is easily my favorite short of all the v h s films   it s about as perfect as it can get and i think expanding it into a feature length film would be risky  the only way i d say it could be pulled off is if gareth evans and timo tjahjanto return to do it  as they re both exceptional filmmakers imho 
the thing i didn t like in kids vs aliens is you have no sympathy for the main characters cause from what we see they are kinda jerks themselves
as is the case with so much short form fiction  it s really easy to mistake a well executed idea for one that should be explored in a feature length format    a lot of stephen king s short stories fit this bill  they re so well executed that you re left wanting more  but in reality what you had was just right  and if you  did  have more you d actually be wishing for less 
not having kids during the trial is more out of an abundance of caution since the drug hasn t been tested in pregnant women or children  this request is not uncommon in any drug trial 
seems pretty fringe science speculative  a study of only   person in moscow who had previously had a bone marrow transplant done to treat their as  not a thing in the usa    reportedly  doctors were able to deplete only those t cells which cause the as leading to complete remission of the disease   if safe  true  replicable and applicable to psa  a doo doo ton of  ifs    it could functionally be a cure for us some day       my bet is that most of us will live to see ourselves cured of this crap 
seems like a very thin line between  we fixed your autoimmune issues  and  now cancer can do what it wants   
i saw a rheumatologist present on this topic recently  he said its exciting  but its so far only tested on   person and we re likely many years away from it being offered  but still  some hope 
 live      sure  if given no choice in the matter  i m quite sure they can keep my failing body alive damn all the consequential pain and suffering as a result   but if you want me to be cooperative and alive    years or so from now  it s going to take a bigger miracle than a cure  because i can t handle    more years of this   i know for sure my friends can t handle it  they ve mostly left at this point  only so many times you can stand someone up and talk about this never ending saga of a disease  i know for sure my doctors can t handle it  because i ve already been handed off within their practice  they say the nicest things to my face  but how much do you wanna have to control someone else s life  including the pain management that the law has told you that you aren t allowed to provide  they told it to me verbatim  they have empathy  they re good people  it hurts them to not be able to help  and so sure  i ve been handed off without really being handed off  the new doctor was described to me as being  more cavalier  and able to help me  aka fuck the law  they know what their patients need   i know for sure my partner can t handle it  only so many aches and pains he can have that i really don t wanna hear about while dealing with way worse  only so many times i can tell him to get his own support network  work with his better feeling friends  work more with his family  because while i love him  i have limits for what i can do  and that certainly goes for being a therapist when i m just not in the mood to provide therapy  i can nod and smile  but the reality is i have my own issues to deal with   sorry for the rant  it s just nothing in my life has destroyed so much than this stupid disease  nothing i have ever done  no choice i ever made  no drug i ever did  nothing  no huge mistakes   just  this  boom  and everything is laid to waste   again  sorry for the rant  i just do not share this optimism  i m not so boldly going the next    years   i ll add something  i m usually the designated driver at bars  i don t like alcohol enough or the prices involved  i just go for the social part  i ll drink one  and thats it  i rarely finish it  i have a zero tolerance policy for drinking and driving  i just won t do it  to me  my worst fear for a long time was doing it once and immediately getting a dui  they say like  one dui       times of actually doing it  but knowing my luck  and fears  it would happen    these days i can say the idea of getting a dui and being raked over the legal coals is almost entertaining    it now compares so little on the scale of what i ve dealt with as a result of psa   so my whole value system at this point is rather shot  it pushes you over the edge  and we adapt  but  man  at what price 
are we the same person  i am in my  rd year of ucd comp sci and whilst i haven t repeated any years  your story sounds remarkably similar  but not one to one  to mine  it sounds like you re a lot worse off than i am though  i got privately diagnosed this year and i m on the tail end of the titration phase of ritalin  idk what advice i could give you since ritalin works decently well for me  i d tell you to try the other stimulant tyvense but i m guessing the psychiatrist doesn t want to prescribe that and you don t have the option of going private  i can t speak for strattera at all  feel free to ask me any questions though  here or in dms 
lol i have the exact same issues  hope you get through it friend  this shit is no joke
i have   kids who went going through uni with undiagnosed adhd autism  each has a different combination  and i was diagnosed very late  you can do this and it s good to know you don t need to be so hard on yourself  and there are options   i was keen to keep my meds on a low dose so i use supplements as a  top up   i was on concerta  slow release  but it built up in my system and i never slept  got panic attacks and endless heart palpitations  so my gp  i don t have access to mental health services or a psychiatrist  switched me to ritalin and i break my tablets to take lower doses on days i don t need it and stronger doses on days that i do  but you can only do that with instant release  then i top up with vitamin b       mg and omega          krill oil      mg and vitamin d  k   complementary to magnesium  and last thing at night i take magnesium l threonate  it s easier to get it all on amazon because i can t find it locally to me  these are all based on finding a calming space   to be honest the best thing i did was join adhd ireland who do specific workshops and online support groups for adults  students  parents and their crown jewel is the umaap programme  understanding   managing adult adhd programme  which is free   online  it looks at adhd a different way and is truly a great programme  you don t need to be diagnosed to do the programme   adhd ireland have a guide for secondary and college uni but i don t know how useful that is  you can access it through the  adhd ireland guide school college  https   adhdireland ie for young people school and college   the first part is secondary school specific  so scroll down to the relevant part    meds aren t always the answer  everyone i ve met that s done umaap said it s life changing    go easy on yourself  and remember this world was set up by neurotypicals for neurotypicals because they like a world where everyone does exactly what they re told and is a yes person  neurodivergent people who challenge the status quo make them unhappy and uncomfortable but we re the people who get things done a different way    additude magazine  https   www additudemag com   is a great resource and the research is legit and qualified  i searched for university and a load of articles came up   there might be some help there   best of luck
ucd compsci grad here  got diagnosed mid degree and now i m still a part time msc student  still at ucd  while working in my graduate role   you ve got a lot going on in your post but feel free to dm me with any questions you have    i ve been through it all  failed modules  angry project teammates  extenuating circumstances applications  med shortages  crying in john dunnion s office  etc  so i m hopeful i can help or give some useful advice
if you d like we have no waiting list at the moment  for more information you can contact us at info cloudclinic ie
i would like to go through private diagnosis and explore lisdex as an option but the costs of college especially when the allowance i get is just about enough for transport and food will make it grueling  although i do luckily fall into ucd s student support fund scheme but unfortunately it s just a   time payment but better than nothing so could maybe use that as a way to slowly build up money for a private assessment  maybe use ritalin s appetite suppression to maybe help with eating less  just have to hope  nd year won t be rough as hell 
superrr rough  my self deprecating ass would think i m a lost cause because other people managed to make it past  st year on their  st attempt blah blah but i m holding out a little bit of hope  hoping you can get through it smoothly and find your ideal solution  not sure about me 
using that side effect you get to save money sounds despair as all hell  have you thought about working  you could apply for a job working in the ucd su shops  their closing date for applications is the   th and you could maybe tell them about your situation  i could maybe help you with the modules you are doing but i kinda just coasted through them myself and don t remember anything  
ye it sounds really really terrible on paper  even the counselor has said it  but maybe some intermittent fasting might be possible to squeeze some savings  i have worked summers before in a warehouse with the help of my dad but because of some incident at the workplace  i was basically let go because of concerns that the incident could happen to me since the victim is of similar stature and age to me    i have no idea what it could be but the thought of having to work at an entirely new place foreign to me just triggers my anxiety  i guess i have trouble with breaking initial routines  like having to leave first job  first house  first school etc etc  not to mention the idea of working in something that involves interacting with people will probably break me since i have always been told by people that i m terrible at communicating and interactions   as for the money made from working  well uhhhh    you can probably already assume     of it went into guilty pleasures that only give me a temporary joy  as well as the fact that i have a fear of thinking that even if i do get private diagnosis and treatment  it would all be in vain because either all treatment options don t work or if one does work  i still end up performing terribly academically because i was born to not be smart or something along those lines     got tiger parents so academic progress is the only thing about me that they care about as well as the only thing about myself i see value in because of this upbringing     i guess i can hope for the hse adult mental health services to become more accessible as opposed to being exclusive to certain catchment areas but who knows if that will happen soon or miles down the road considering this has been one of the biggest criticisms the entirety of ireland has had for its own health services    appreciate the offer to help with modules but i would not want anyone to deal with how slow my brain is  not even my worst enemies  you ve got a golden heart 
 administration of rgls     has shown clear improvements in kidney function  size  and other measures of disease severity in preclinical models   this is the part i care about  but kind of vague  any more detailed results from the other cohorts

preclinical is not really   much to put hope in   there have been a lot of things that worked in preclinicals but not in human trials  sadly   tkv size is going to be the deciding factor  i would think  at least to me its the key thing  if the tkv reverses shrinks  more than likely the decline will stop along with it  or greatly slow down   if you prevent decline   but your kidneys keep growing  you are going to end up with such a low quality of life  i m not sure i would consider it worth it   no  there really isnt any solid data yet other than cohort   had a dose dependent reaction to the drug and the   with the greatest reaction had a     reduction in tkv over   months  we don t know if the others had any reduction at all though  or even if they kept growing  and   people at    is within margin of error for mri s too

this company is a scam
no it s not   raza bokahri was kicked out as ceo and has nothing to do with the company anymore as he tried to funnel             fsd is not a scam they have real ip for multiple sclerosis
anthony durkacz still on the board it s a scam that guys the king of pump and dumps
that is libel and irresponsible comment fsd needs all the support it can get to advance to phase   clinical trials my friend 
well good thing they ve got delusional pumpers like yourself to spread their garbage
remyelinating therapy for ms coming closer to phase  
so  wouldn t this trial have to be repeated in north america to achieve us fda approval   and is the australian framework accelerated since there s no drugs on market for this currently   i m trying to look for a  patient impact  silver lining  but i think im just seeing a press release for long term shareholders  
unfortunately  there are still years of waiting for this medicine if it doesn t fail during phases   and     i heard from one of the medicinal researchers that before phase   it s senseless to get excited    overall it s good information but doesn t say anything relevant to us now 
they passed phase  a already next is phase  b   then phase  a can start i assume   fsd needs as much support as they can get for sharing their info on all their trials etc
to compare similar r r patient group  we should compare uproleselan and sls     right  and in that case sls    is much more promissing  maybe it s not that straight forward  but please correct me 
thanks gabri  interesting read as always 
any info on the os in the cr  subset in this study in each arm  without sct
hi gabri  would you be able to clarify the difference in populations between the viale p  trial for aza ven vs  the p  regal trial   i m having trouble detmermining how the     month os from viale relates to the regal group  i know there is a broader criteria for patients in that trial   also  when tabulating the os would deaths from side effects be excluded or included in the outcome and os  it states     of patients had fatal events caused by the treatments  gps has been observed to have little no side effects in most patients    thanks 
the r r aml patients treated with sls    are much more difficult to be treated than the ones in the uproleselan trial  because the sls    study exclusively selects the r r aml patients with a previous documented failure of ven  this is not the case for uproleselan  which is associated with a very poor mos of       months  so no  we cannot compare the two drugs because they target patients with a different prognostic profile  the one in sls    being much worse 
out of the    r r aml in this ph    study     reached a cr cri  state     of them underwent stem cell transplant    cr  did not  there is no info on the outcome for these  cr  patients 
hi  viale a is an   induction treatment   for previously untreated patients with confirmed aml who are ineligible for standard induction therapy because of coexisting conditions  because they are    years of age or older  or both    https   pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov            https   pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov             deaths due to side effects count for the calculation of the overall survival   regal is   a maintenance treatment   for aml patients in cr  without the prospect of undergoing stem cell transplant   then  we have a different phase   trial called   viale m    m stands for maintenance   it is oral azacitidine with or without venetoclax as maintenance in cr  aml patients   it is closed for enrollment  results not yet published  looking forward to seeing those results
how are you having a hard time    viale os of      mos is for front line  newly diagnosed  previously untreated patients   deaths from side effects of course are included    you have been infected by the short con 
alright  this is clicking  i believe since current guidelines say ven aza and ven dec is reserved for those    yo w  comorbidities  you re able to confidently state that glyc s r r population is healthier  no    glyc trial participants were eligible even if they had received   hsct    mo prior   during the trial they received mec or fai  because these were even options  it tells us the population was inherently healthier   a documented failure of ven essentially means sls    participants have no therapeutic options aside from another course of ven aza or ven dec  otherwise they d be eligible for mec flag ida other therapy options  i d assume   thus  they re forced back to a ven combo which is futile and results in a much lower mos   gabri s saying it s like comparing apples to oranges   you can t compare healthier  younger r r aml patients to older sicker r r aml patients  the healthier patients have access to hsct and better chemotherapy regimens   if i m totally off i m going to delete this post  to avoid confusion  and scourge myself 
the fact there is no info on the out come  is telling   the outcome is very poor 
by the time patients get into cr    ven aza will have exhausted its use 
not at all  i am simply asking a question of someone who has much greater understanding of biotech and specifically the aml field  i have a whopping     months of experience researching biotech since i started investing so as much as i have learned a ton  i will lean on those with more knowledge to backup what i have learned

if you spent half as much time researching stocks and putting together a plan for investing  trading rather then getting all emotional about one stock maybe you would have more success  may i ask why you want to keep adding to a losing position   what is the plan  average down then hold for the long term  i usually do the opposite and add to my winners on the corrections  if in an uptrend 
so  my electric battery shot followers  neg    pos    the trend for shot is still down  if this trend continues we should see shot between      to       per share by friday at the close  no significant news  good or bad  will be coming for at least the next   weeks  so  all shorts should be considering selling   around        buyers should wait until it falls below        i ll be watching for a signal that it has bottomed for my next buy  at which time i will be adding another  k shares  life is short  enjoy each day    
i called for ss to fall to       to      by the end of the end of the week  it  low of       today  will it go lower by end of day       how low can it go  i want to know        or lower would really be nice    i just have question for those posting here about shot  are you a stick holder and have you actually tried the drink 
i heard the reason the study is delayed is because safety shot was too effective and the participants can no longer feel any effects of alcohol  doomed to a lifetime of sobriety   they fucked up the ratios of filtered water  caffeine  and ginseng   that s why there s no repeat buyers on amazon  nobody can get drunk anymore so there s no reason to buy more safety shot 
you are so dumb     you come to this safety shot sub to tell me  what i should do with my money  you think i m emotional about my investment  you are wrong  i m emotional about fraudsters  bashers  liars in this sub and other subs  people that spend their time shitting on investors and badmouthing their investment  while shorting it and profiting off the regular investors  that listen to their shit talk  like leeches  contributing nothing of value to the society    yes  sometimes i m a bit emotional about these kind of asshats    but i m absolutely calm when it comes to my investment decision into safety shot  i see the future and the potential  and i like what i see  
attention alcoholics  don t drink safety shot  you ll never get drunk again  no more need for aa meetings  no more therapy required  safety shot is your path to recovery  now that is the funniest thing i have ever heard      
did you drink a safety shot after drinking alcohol  and did you test your results with a breathalyzer  because i did  and i did not like what i see  you claim to be emotional about fraudsters    we ll see how emotional you get when this fraudulent company gets exposed   and you won t be able to say that you weren t warned 
you ll love the story about my buddy then   he was drinking safety shot all night and got stopped at a dui checkpoint  the cop made him chug a beer before he could drive off because he was too sober   this shit is dangerous 
lol  
he hasn t tested it  he literally has no idea       
for years now  i see accounts like yours  that are screeming fraud and scam in tandem with so called research agencies  shortseller  that are writing very long and detailed hit pieces  capybara research  hindenburg research  citroen research   these disgusting parasites are part of short and distort compaigns against startups and pennystocks  your bashing accounts are easy to spot  not easy to proof but  i mean     come on    you guys are so obviouse in being trash     if the company is a scam  i m all for it  that they rott in jail  but what i see are allagations by shortsellers  capybara  and their paid accounts  you   like i saw it many many times  and in this case  i want to see you rott in jail    time will tell  but your bashing accounts are just not trustworthy in any way     
to sober  how in the hell can you be too sober  and you just proved a point  ss works    
where are you located 
he blew a       
if you give me your adress  i l give you mine  
a       never of that  of coarse your pulling my leg 
not very good at answering questions  are you 
not interested in a conversation with a basher  i m only here to call you guys and your scheme out  why should i give you any private information about me  so you can use it agains me in your next post    what else should you use it for 
i d like to figure out the chances of us meeting up  i have a few   packs of safety shot and a breathalyzer  matter of fact  the next time you  or anyone else in this forum  for that matter  find yourself in san diego  hit me up if you want to learn the truth about this product 
i m sure you are deep depp into conspiracy theories as well mate  add me on face book if you want  matthew lamond  i ll run through how me and capybara are writing scam pieces to scam you out of your hard earned  also  i m on hot copper as dumb fruit if you wanna check my post history  you re an absolute nut job mate  just like every other nut here who calls basher on someone with different opinions  you will never make money in the markets  to close minded
i will learn the truth about this product  but not from a strange basher account      if i were in the usa  i had ordered it by my self at amazon or www drinksafetyshot com  because everyone in the us can do that by their own     and everyone should do it 
how many  others  do you see here  that are calling you out     are these  others   in the room with you  do you have a little paranoia    visit a doctor  please  
yes and     of the amazon purchasers lefts a negative review      
you asked me where excatly you lie  here you have it  thanks for platantly confirming  that you lie to spread your narrative        it is not     it s nowhere near      you are just a fucking liar 
you re an idiot        good luck with your continued failure of an investment lol  it must suck to lose so much money hahahahhaa
wow  now you ve shown me                                                             
you re obsessed with me  you can t help but to reply to me  
yes  maybe i love you     but wait     you respondet to me earlier     maybe you love me     
eroror      please re upload
it works perfectly for me  i just checked it on my pc  the antivirus probably kicks you out   here s the abstract   https   europepmc org article med           https   europepmc org article med            edit  i just tried one more time but i couldn t find the full text anywhere but sci hub
thanks a lot     
anytime 
i take it and haven t noticed any side effects  no big improvements either 
it s an immunosuppressant  so some of the more serious side effects  if you google  will be things like cancer and stuff like that  it s the rheum s job to determine if the benefit of you taking it outweighs the risk  the decision is also  of course  up to you   i take azathioprine and have not had any serious side effects  maybe a week of upset stomach when i started  it s hard to remember  everyone has different reactions to different drugs  but the main adverse reactions to azathioprine  from my understanding  is gi distress  a good way to avoid this with a lot of meds is to titrate up  but obviously ask your doctor first  from my understanding azathioprine is generally well tolerated   edit  a good trial period for a rheumatic drug would be at least three months  though six would be better  they take forever to get into your system and start working 
i m on it  i have zero side effects and i must say that i m grateful  my rheumy warned me that i d feel really nauseous or throw up and i was looking out for that side effect  but no such thing 
hello  symptoms can vary depending on the individual  that s what i said to myself before i was diagnosed  i don t have butterfly rashes  my arms or legs are not swollen  i don t have mouth ulcers so it can t be lupus     if you look up the lupus umbrella diagram  there are   pillars that address which body part organs lupus attacks first  lupus nephritis affects the kidneys  cutaneous lupus affects only the skin  antiphospholipid antibody syndrome affects the blood and so on    so for my case  lupus went straight for my kidneys  which is why i didn t have any physical symptoms like skin rashes  mouth ulcers  a lot was happening internally like proteins in my urine  low proteins in blood  anemia  etc  make sure you talk to your rheu and get more test done if needed  a proper diagnose will give you a better understand on your condition 
i ve never been on this med  but pretty much every single immunosuppressant med i ve taken over the last    years for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has lymphoma as a potential side effect  it s something to pay attention to  but don t obsess about it  be a compliant patient  go to your doctor appointments on the schedule that they want to see you  take your meds  get your labs done as they are ordered  get your screenings on schedule  be vigilant about paying attention to your body and bring up anything weird quickly  the most important thing is to have a good relationship with your doctors and develop that level of trust  confidence and understanding with them  they are your partners in this lifelong health journey  they will have your back  hang in there  i m sorry you re going through this  it s scary  and it sucks  but it s manageable 
i took it for over   years and did really well on it  it helped me go into remission 
azathioprine has been pretty great for me   for any of the  scarier  potential side effects  you will have blood tests which should help mitigate risk   usually you can slowly increase or decrease dose to hit a dose that helps you while minimizing other side effects   one reason i was given aza was because it s good for skin and joint pain   even though you don t have skin stuff going on  it might still help with other symptoms     with dsdna being positive  it s very very likely you have lupus    false negatives  for that test aren t the most common  but even in the case of false negatives people with positive dsdna do still usually have one or more other diseases   so i d be willing to wager whatever other symptoms you have are related to your increased dsdna antibodies   i started hcq and aza at the same time so i can t be sure which drug decreased my dsdna antibody titer  but it will be cool if after trying out aza for a bit  a repeat test is done if you have less symptoms and can see if less symptoms correlated with less or negative anti dsdna antibody  often in lupus at least  severity of symptoms increases with dsdna although this is not always the case      make sure if they haven t already  that they do a tpmt enzyme test   tpmt is a key enzyme that processes out aza  so if you turn up to be a low or intermediate metabolizer  less tpmt activity than most people   you ll want to increase dosage of aza in smaller increments to make sure all is well   low and intermediate metabolizers can be at higher risk for side effects  so the smaller dosage changes up are good for making sure your blood counts don t get negatively effected   this isn t the only enzyme that metabolizes aza  so like   i m an intermediate metabolizer so i went up doses slowly but i guess my other enzyme is cool so i m able to be on the same maximum dose as a normie       because i started both hcq and aza at once  it s hard to say how long until i felt positive effects for aza  but i do notice more joint pain  fatigue  headache  heart rate issues  etc if i go down my dose within maybe a month and a half   i m jumping around a bit because adhd and also excitement about talking about drugs  so i m sorry about the confusing novel   lymphoma is a listed risk  but you will get regular blood testing as your dose is adjusted up over time and then when you re on a stable dose  every     months   if it helps  i read a recent publication from      that suggests azathioprine might not even be the cause for increased risk of lymphoma   it is a      meta analysis that looked at ulcerative colitis and crohn s patients with or without azathioprine prescription   and incidendence of non hodgkin s lymphoma was the same in both groups suggesting the underlying disease may be the cause   most papers before this looking at lymphoma in azathiorpine prescribed patients are using crohn s and uc patients   it is found there is increased risk of melanoma   so use your sunscreen and practice safe sun habits 
i m on it   starting it was rough but that was because i was tapering off prednisone and dealing with blood sugar challenges on top of everything   the most notable side effect i had was nausea   i found taking it at night time was helpful     i imagine there must be a significant reason for your health care professionals to jump to this medication   i ve been placed on it due to lupus attacking my platelets     overall i ve been on it for the better part of a year and it has helped keep my disease activity in check but i am also on plaquenil and saphnelo infusions     i will say that i ve been through the ringer the past   weeks with a respiratory infection   first viral but i think i had a secondary bacterial infection as well   had to get some antibiotics and finally seeing some improvement   basically i have to be cautious of bacterial infections due to the suppression of the immune system 
on and off it haven t noticed much of a difference
i recently switched over from cellcept in feb  now at our goal of    mg daily   i must say i really felt the change the first few weeks  beyond tired  upset stomach  and light headed  i have since came back to my  normal  and feel good  lmk if you have any questions 
thank you  i hate taking meds and in the last year it s just been med after med  it s unnerving  so thank you  i appreciate the response 
lucky     i struggled with the nausea but was able to get through it 
i understand  i don t have issues with meds  but i know lots of people do  people these days with lupus are living longer and longer  and part of that is due to the meds we take  life expectancy for someone with a lupus diagnosis used to be      years  now it s nearly normal 
i started the article excited but quickly deflated  the finding about calcium channels into the cells being broken is good  the more evidence we build the better   and reversing it with naltrexone is welcome  but we know that ldn helps but doesn t fix me cfs  i don t think the     person trial is going to tell us anything we don t know already  surely there is a better use for researchers time and money 
i was in an ldn trial at stanford until recently  left voluntarily but still take   mg nightly   stanford only took blood samples at the start  they didn t regularly collect and look at blood samples cell activity  it also was not double blind  everyone received the drug  i think this study is building on that work  which is great to see 
low dose nalterxone   ldn  has been in use for ages    the griffith tprm  calcium ion hypothesis has been around for ages too  this is the first time i ve seen them married like this  with evidence of effectiveness in vitro  i m wondering what  aspect  of the cells function was restored by ldn 
i disagree  firstly  many doctors still won t prescribe ldn and having studies back its efficacy is probably the only thing that will help to change that  but further   we currently don t know how it works and why it helps some and not others  if we can understand the mechanisms behind its activity better  we may be able to use it more effectively  or open up avenues for different treatments 
i try to look at it this way  if they re catching up to the stuff we ve already discovered about me cfs  then soon they have to try new stuff right       right 
do we actually already have real studies and paper exploring this  a phd student would not re do something like that 
totally agree  we already know ldn sort of works a little bit for some people    lets put these resources into trying something new 
i believe the ion channel thing has already been a topic of research in chronic pain  an australian dr i tried to get in to see researches it    edit  i was misremembering  the dr i am thinking of was researching sodium channels  not calcium channels  and i think he may have been a fraud  but i am not sure 
hard agree  wish they d stop fannying about trying to reinvent the wheel over and over  ldn is helpful to some but by no means anywhere near a cure  it s used at harmlessly low doses  it is the easiest thing in the world to get hold of with or without rx  and a single   mg tablet can be dissolved into solution that will provide about   weeks  worth of doses  for the love of god why can t they just trial something of substance 
jarred younger keeps on trying to test dextro naltrexone  but he s not been able to as of yet   it s nice to see this space slowly changing and more funding starting to be available 
i m not aware of such studies  but that doesn t meant there isn t any   i think there is strong consensus in the community that ldn works a bit for some people  my guess is that is what the trial will show  if true  it doesn t really change the life of anyone with me cfs  it s just confirmation of a well accepted theory 
you do need empirical evidence to motivate fundings for other directions  this study may also show that ldn is useless in their case study  opening a new scientific question around why it is helpful for some people  it s good that the community consensus gets challenged by empirical studies 
  i think there is strong consensus in the community that ldn works a bit for some people  my guess is that is what the trial will show  if true  it doesn t really change the life of anyone with me cfs   i get that everyone wants to jump straight to a big perfect cure  but that isn t going to happen  instead we formalise what is already known and proceed by inches      published evidence is better than a strong consensus     if they can define a susbet ldn works on that will be amazing  not solely because it allows the drug to be targeted but becuase then we know a bit more about the mechanism of the disease

where do you live  one of the things i focused on when i was researching mba options was which school s alumni had a big presence where i currently live  online mbas are often a resume check box  so it s good if it s a school that carries some weight where you are    broadly speaking  more people are familiar with nebraska than south dakota  so i d lean that way all else being equal 
i will be living and working in rural western pennsylvania  my plan was to work here for two years while completing my mba  so there aren t really any ties to either school in my location  but i did assume it would just be a resume checkbox  i would have considered a bigger school like bu or u ill but they only matriculate in the fall and spring and i wanted to start this summer  my situation is a little strange and unorthodox because i also do want to try to apply for residency this fall and thought maybe the mba would look good on the application along with the teaching 
what you probably don t know is that the team of scientists who created the medicine most likely live in sub par conditions  they probably got a nice pat on the back and a bicycle for helping cuba make millions with this medicine  source  my uncle was on the team that created a famous pill and all he got was a bike with the title of the bike signed by fidel himself 
hey slow kid   nobody  least of all the people on this thread   think cubans incapable of performing science   so what  we know that not a penny of this discovery will be used to improve the lives of the cuban people  just to enrich the corrupt government   that s evil 
nobody here says cuban bio pharma is bad  they are really good  and mostly go to international markets  now when you compare vs the hospitals and quality of care and medicine availability in the island is when you see most of the complaints 
nazi germany had some very talented scientists  incredible breakthroughs by the biotech industry is not really a reflection of the quality of life on the island 
why do you call cubans anti cubans  who taught you  randy de la mesa retonta  and it doesn t diminish the point of being a brutal dictatorship and an island of missery  i dont see those being mutually exclusive  regresa pa la  ico lopez claria de alcantarilla
releasing a vaccine doesn t ignore the fact that people get    years in prison for filming a protest  that there s no freedom of expression  of press  of assembly  of thought  or that the quality of life of the common people is terrible  especially for old people 
what s the issue here   noone ever said that cuba has incompetent scientists  so it doesn t surprise me that they made a good drug   that s not the criticism of the cuban system    cuba has always been able to achieve impressive things that garner prestige for the state  like angola  
but are they able to produce any without electricity for    hours a day 
brace yourself  earth shattering reality incoming   two things can be true
this is kind of a straw man  medicine can t be  communist  only governments  cubans don t discredit the quality of doctors in cuba  cuba has very talented doctors  it s the management of them that s terrible    also  dedicating all your resources to medicine will yield good results  but at what expense though  that s our problem
oh man i bet op believes cuba cured cancer too
this is an interesting post  can the op explain how this  cutting edge  medication s clinical trial approved by the fda slipped through the cracks of the  evil embargo   asking for an  anti cuban  friend    fyi  there s nothing more  anti cuban  than the dictatorship in havana  but good try  you idiots love to come up with lame labels to demonize the opposition and manipulate the narrative  since  gus no  is a censored word here now you re switching to  anti cubano  para burlar la censura 
cuba can also develop medicine  therefore  communism wins  lol

i m so confused by some of these people  do they really think that cuban   isn t   n subpar conditions  that the people of cuba aren t suffering daily with food shortages  clean water  electricity  or basic human dignities    i m as liberal as they come  but these che guevara tshirt wearing dumbfucks are really lost 
can you please clarify  who do you call  anti cubans  
now imagine if cuba didn t have such a restrictive government   cuba has much potential   that is the argument all  anti cubans  make 
let me clear your head  cuba s health concerns are not because of the professionals  it s because there s no intention from behalf of the government to supply hospitals  not even a simple repair  plus there s shortage of everything you can name that a health institution needs  the only people that have top  st world access to medical treatment are tourists and the leaders  cuba has a lot of talent not only good doctors but none of that serves no purpose if you have to work in an or fill with cockroaches  add to that that most of those patents are not property of cuba but to the chinese and russian government  as they have sold their patents in agriculture and so far  everyone respects cubans because with even the limitations they have they manage to perform
it s good to see heberprot p approved by the fda for clinical trials in the us because it is yet another powerful reminder of existing opportunities for us cuba cooperation in the medical field  the loud criticism by staff of joe biden s successful      presidential election campaign at bernie sanders for doubling down on his complimentary comments about fidel castro s social services for rural cubans in a february      interview on     minutes  was why joe biden s administration reminds itself that privately acknowledging cuba s advances in the field of medicine are not a prelude to praising castro for promoting free of charge medical facilities for rural cubans 
this is like asking homeopathic doctor how to cure cancer   a really bad idea
remember guys  it s awesome righteous freedom when a corporation hoards the means to make and also the profits from a medication  but when a government does it that s evil dictator communism
so much propaganda but it never fully convinces the useful idiots abroad to migrate to cuba  they always choose to defend the dictatorship from the comforts of capitalism  lol
this is a awesome  the researchers at cngm were talking about this when i visited last year  i m happy that this finally got approved 
 title of the bike   you mean like car title 
scientists who work for big pharma in the us just get their salary   the company founder owner owns the valuable patent  not them   just saying 
i m sorry your uncle your uncle couldn t hoard wealth while others starve 
thats a lie  show the proofs   come on  show here the numbers of the accounts   even the cia cant show it   
the hospitals and the quality care are directly related to the consecuences of the economic war of usa  i was with my father in a hospital until he dies in july       he always received all the medicines than the doctors said  even the emergency surgery was made  in the middle of a worst moment of the covid 
claria de alcantarilla has to be the funniest insult i have heard today  thank you
mira  gusanito de cuarta  lo que te pasa es que no tienes un argumento  acaba de explicar como en tu  isla de la miseria  pueden producir vacunas as   y mucho m s  so yegua  con perd n de las yeguas   explica si puedes como es que los  cubanos anticubanos  no logran derrocar al gobierno  sabes por qu     porqu  son una partida de pendejos esperando que los marines hagan el trabajo  
there are black panthers still in us jail for protesting against vietnam   you don t get to judge others when your own country does worse
there is humanitarian trade carve out in the embargo  i think that was added by clinton before he left office 
capitalist countries invent         medicines  op sleeps   communist country invents one medicine  op asks if communism is the greatest thing to ever exist
op is having a  gotcha  moment for some reason 
because that shows the lies about cuba   cuba is show in this sub like a place worst than hait   they never said here that  for example  cuba create at least   vaccines against covid     and all the cuban people and even mexicans  venezuelans  were vaccinated with those vaccines    if you tell them that roswell park institute is cooperating with cuba to test the cuban vaccine cimavax against lunst cancer in usa  they could tell u  thats propaganda   although even pbs made a documentary about that   if you tell  them  than we have usa young people studying medicine in cuba  they told you  thats a communist propaganda    
agree        i m as liberal as they come as well but reality is  what it is   really not worth arguing with them  they ll always believe that che was the consummate humanitarian when in fact  he was a murderer   they ll always believe fidel improved the lot of cubans when in fact  he destroyed the country   they ll always believe health care and education in cuba is top notch without acknowledging that the  great  health care is only available to foreigners and the top echelons of the state and that education in cuba is nothing more than indoctrination   cuba developed a pill  whoop dee doo   the developers will get an e bike and an extra ration of rice   congratulations   
dude i have made this argument for over    years  when talking to communists i always ask why don t you go to cuba  their heads explode  like        of communists actually move to communist countries lol  i think part of a communist spirit is just revolution for sake of revolution  undermining and subverting traditional governments is just what these people convince themselves life is about
no  car title  they have like a proof of ownership  that s what was signed
how much is that salary 
not true  company own patent right but if you re on patent  you will get royalty  and scientists on patent all time 
bruh the cuban government is hoarding wealth while their people starve  just how ignorant are you  have you seen the president with his fancy rolex and have you seen the majority of the population dumpster diving 
sorry my uncle couldn t get paid an actual living wage ftfy
i can t tell if you re trolling or incredibly autistic 
jejeje tu eres de los que pronto o viene por parol o cruza la frontera   veras  como tu los he conocido  no discuto xon clarias  mi argumento es que el posible desarrollo en alguna esfera en cuba  no necesariamente se traduce en bienestar para el pueblo  sino todo lo contrario  porque se logra a expensas de quitarle bienes y servicios  de los pocos que tienes  para la dictadura obtener puntos a nivel mundial  hasta la alemania nazi tuvo puntos positivos  no hay relacion alguna entre cuba produciendo cierto medicamento  ser una dictadura y tener al pueblo en la mas absoluta miseria  o no esta el pueblo en la mas absoluta miseria  miento   
i doubt they got in jail for filming a protest  gtfo here with your false dichotomy 
a humanitarian carve out for americans who need treatment for foot ulcers 
the more i talk to them about their beliefs the more i realize we will never get along  i wouldn t call them  stupid     i think psychotic maybe a better word
co ooooo este descarado ense a su cara por aqu  de nuevo 
they want to parasite where the capitalist wealth is  not where it used to be 
 if you love capitalism so much  why don t you go to war torn areas in israel    that s how absurd your own argument is    people are moving to richer countries all the time  always  billions of people migrate from capitalist countries to other capitalist countries due to poverty    from exploited countries  to the countries that do the exploiting  it s like saying  people in british colonies move over to the uk  that s proof that the uk is better   a country that exploits others is fundamentally gonna be better off  than the exploited ones    how does that correlate to that country s system actually being better  even in the slightest   maybe we shouldn t glorify a system that stands on the robbery of others   your argument completly undermines why countries are poor or rich to begin with   
it can probably pull some serious cash in collectors circles 
 like all other technology companies  drug companies have their employees assign all their patents to them    employees who get a patent granted typically get a small bonus in return    
so you just disagree with who is hoarding the wealth  that s pretty fucked up 
sorry your uncle had to share ftfy
    
your dad was probably a gusano
they went to jail for protesting  what part of that didn t you understand 
an ulcer on a diabetic is basically death  it will never heal 
i think if i were a communist id try to say china is still communist since government owns much of the economy and they still have the red flag etc  then id try to claim their success as communist w s  i think thats the easiest path  and if someone brings up cuba you just say there are capitalist countries poorer than cuba    i m not making these arguments myself im just saying i think there are smarter ways to do pro communist stuff on the internet 
keep talking to yourself while ignoring reality   ignore all of history  ignore all of external affairs  ignore all of corruption   it s much easier to just form a worldview of  just trade  everyone consents  so it must be good  and say  socialism bad  instead of criticially analyzing the issues    you have the mindset of a    year old teenager in the us    i seriously hope you grow out of that phase one day   
nope my argument is as simple as  if you like country with x economic system  you d go there instead of changing your own countries  economic system  that s literally what you just argued lol  billions of people migrate due to economic reasons 
i m pretty sure he already used that paper to wipe his ass   lol
i didn t say that  i m not even going to address just how stupid that is  that is one of the biggest logical fallacies i ve ever seen 
your mother gets stuffed by gusanos every night for soap probably 
show me the proof
i often hear from them that china communism is proof that communism works 
i wish i was    and in the us  at that age i was doing forced child labor for the communist dictatorship you defend from the comforts of capitalism  perhaps that s what you need to suffer to finally understand what impoverishing socialism is about in practice
again  you are confusing economic system with general quality of the country   you can the concept of economy x  but that doesn t mean you have to like country z that uses economy x  if its quality of the country is bad  the economy can certainly be a factor to the quality  but in many cases  factors such as exploitation  invasions  sanctions  etc  or even just simple corruption  that s why quality also doesn t actually     correlate to the actual morality or quality of the general system  you can have a great system but be exploited or corrupted  you can be a terrible system  but exploit others    again  if the decision of where people move was just the economic system  then millions of people would go to capitalist countries  even if their quality is poor  and that s what you are arguing here  that people should go to socialist countries with poor quality  how is this different to advocating to go to capitalist countries with poor quality 
that guy reads a book of logical fallacies before he logs on reddit lol  it s like pulling teeth trying to have an honest argument with him
so you think hoarding wealth and resources is wrong  because wait until i tell you about capitalism    
shows the character of gusanos
you really can t google or search black panthers still in us jail   not to mention political prisoners from other parts of the world are in gautanimo bay jfc
all socialist countries are poor quality lol  cuba had way better quality before it was communist  all it fuckin took was a return to democracy and cuba would be way better off lol  in cuba s case  z country is bad because of economic system x  communists argue that cuba is good and or better than it used to be but won t go there  and pre revolution cuba had way more immigrants to it and way less emigrants out of it  after revolution cuba had wayyyy more emigrants out of it and way less immigrants into it 
this guy has never read a book and lies about what happened to his family  i d take what he says with a grain of salt 
stop talking about your gusano loving mother like that 
show the fucking proof or gtfo with your false dichotomy  imagine comparing a member of an armed political organization to a single mother recording a protest  the stupid audacity of you people never cease to amuse me 
i mean  that s already kinda skipping the conversation before it really began  all you were settling in now is saying  all of them are poor quality   despite that not only ignoring the actual argument  but also already establishing the groundworks into just bashing an economic system  you aren t discussing  is this argument really valid   but rather  capitalism   socialism   if you want to discuss that  sure  but it s leaving the scope of the initial conversation or expands it to rather unreasonable amounts if you do actually come back to it  somehow using that conclusion 
guarantee you ve never been to cuba  let alone live there and yet you have an opinion like you know what you re talking about  it s so easy to be a communist from canada 
it s not a false dichotomy an armed political organization not all were armed as it is within their rights to be armed in the  st place you child
it s not a false dichotomy an armed political organization not all were armed as it is within their rights to be armed in the  st place you child 
why are communists so obsessed with changing the entire fabric of the united states instead of moving to cuba  it s a fair question and one that you didn t answer nor connected to how my argument is flawed  most communists never actually live or have ever lived in communist countries  my argument isn t flawed because it remains  why do advocates for economic system x never actually freely live in said economic systems  it s a disingenuous desire which seems to have ulterior motives because you don t  actually  want communism itself  you want to change the system that exists
i m american  pretty creepy you went looking through my comments to find that out  though 
i said show me your fucking proof you stupid child
the reason is  as i explained before  quality of a country     quality of a general system  by advocating that people should go to poor corrupt countries because it matches the system they generally like  you are creating a fallacy in which you must logically apply the same to any kind of system  if you don t  then all you actually do is ideologic talking   
dude  you re using a profile on a public forum  get over yourself  if you want to switch citizenship  i got a couple of cousins willing to do the trade  you could be sucking on raul s nuts by the end of the month  
https   www google com amp s www bbc com news world us canada          amp  there  you fricking child 
well in cuba s case  quality of the country   the economic system  a closer look at the facts and circumstances point to communism fucking things up  i m not entirely aware of other countries but there seems to have been a general trend of communism ruining a country  cuba  north korea  china  russia  vietnam  etc  no communist ever wants to go to these places  even in the case of the soviet union  no one was moving there and the countries annexed all wanted to leave
ok stalker  
 sundiata acoli      was sentenced to life in prison in      for the murder of a police officer the previous year    the shooting that led to acoli s imprisonment followed a routine traffic stop on the new jersey turnpike    the ensuing gunfight left a new jersey state trooper  werner foerster  dead  and another wounded    in       a state assigned psychologist determined that acoli  appeared remorseful  and had expressed  deep regret  for his role in foerster s death     i deeply regret the actions that transpired   he said   those were turbulent and fearful times    where the fuck was he filming a protest you comepinga   it s so easy to catch you mfs in your own web of lies and deceptions  the guy literally killed an officer and you pricks pretend to compare it to a mother filming a fucking protest  you re insanely stupid  get help and fuck right off  
and equally  there seems to be a trend among capitalist countries being rather poor  the only exclusions are specfically countries that have completly invaded  imperialist or straightup enslaved other countries in order to gather wealth  eg  colonial countries such as most of central europe  ones that split from those countries such as us or australia  etc   the riches of a country barely ever actually conclude from its economic system  but just how it plunders the riches of others  and in capitalism specifically  this is an imbedded system    furthermore  the world isn t just as simple as  country z has economic system x  and has a good quality  therefore system x is also good   it has as mentioned  countless of moving parts that influence the actual politics  you can have capitalism with completly free markets with   restrictions  or you can have capitalism with restricted planned economies  the outcomes and actual decisions people in power can make will vary by a long shot  or heck  the amount they want to give to their actual people can make the biggest distinction   equally  concluding  the soviet union closed down  therefore it was bad  is equally nothing but just observing the surface while ignoring the history  and heck  when ignoring the history and consequences  this argument is just nothing but even victim blaming  p    shockers is  external affairs exist  it ignores all the actual events that have taken place  all the statistics that showcase how well a country was doing for its historic place  and even how the people were feeling   in the majority of cases  the countries were doing much better than their capitalist counterparts  who had equal developmental progress at that time  studies comparing their quality of life showcase this  the keypoint here is to compare countries that have equal conditions    that s the scientific method  if you compare a prior slave state with dozens of sanctions and internal corruption  to a colonial and imperial super power such as france  then you are obviously gonna bias the results in your favor    another thing to mention about the general state of the ussr  was the fact its economy  gdp per capita  grew by over       in its lifetime  compareably  the us and other even imperalist countries didn t even grew by      in that same time  the state of the same countries after the reforms is also not really favorable towards capitalism  a lot of countries still to this day have worse economies than they had back then  and even for those that have finally increased it by now  the setback of the reform results in a lower total economy that they could ve had  if they didn t have the reform to begin with  even towards the argument  many wanted to leave the ussr   just being wrong  a good majority want it back  even by now  russia              ukraine              belarus  moldova and armenia                  and     respectively  all saying their country went worse after the downfall of the ussr  literally nobody actually wanted it  so you can probably tell that it wasn t really much of a democratic decision  was it 
 he was in fear for his life  it s so easy to catch you idiot libertarians
i don t care if pigs die especially american pigs
no  capitalist countries aren t poor lol  you re thinking of third world countries  usa didn t even do much overseas till late   th century and it was very wealthy  gdp is fine except at what cost did ussr implement policies that resulted in gdp  and it was the only fully marxist country    once again  in cuba s case  the economic system is the reason for its bad shape  it was in better shape overall before 
says the comepinga who literally compares the killing of a police officer to filming a protest   he was in fear for his life   really  in fucking nj do you think they wouldn t have released the guy if he didn t do it  if he had a good case  the bastion of trump hating liberal democrats  triple comemierda  you show how ignorant and viciously deceitful you are every time you try to compare the two 
so what  they are involved in the capitalist process  even if you are gonna say  that isn t real capitalism   other countries still exploit them  what kind of reasoning is this supposed to be  you re creating an orthodox argument  in which all things good happening in capitalism are due to capitalism  and all bad things happening in relations to it just aren t capitalism  it s still slavery  even if you make it happen in their own countries  does it suddenly not make it that  just because it doesn t happen in your own backyard  was slavery not done in capitalist countries because the slaves didn t contribute to the capitalist market by themselves  this argument is beyond absurd     also  what is that  the us didn t do much overseas till late   th century    did you just forget the entire atlantic slave trades that happened basically since its creation  i would heavily consider that imperalism lmao  to your second question  well  would you wanna answer that yourself  the statistics that look at the quality of life in those countries show a pretty good picture if you ask me  something that displays objective consequences  and not individual events     and  for cubas case  is the same you can say for all socialist countries  in basically all of their cases  life got drastically worse after going for capitalism  if you wanna use this argument for being anti socialism  then you have to acknowledge all the reverse arguments that would speak for anti capitalism  you can t just cherry pick them 
you re literally a fascist   there are right wing extremists that have killed cops and have a much lenier sentence than any on the left
learn what logical fallacies actually are because you are essentially straw manning me to point out that i m the one with a flawed argument  stick to the actual argument   communism ruined cuba  go move there if you want communism  period
your mom is the fascist one  see how it shows the reactionary prick that she raised  gaslighting a fucking mother for filming a protest and equating it to a literal murderer  then coming off with no other counter argument other than utter  muh fascism  like your lot of useful idiots regularly do  you couldn t even show a proof that would help your point  bozo 
and all i am pointing out is how   a  this argument is hypocritical  as it can be used on capitalist countries too   b   communism  not being the sole factor  as observed by other socialist countries as well   your statement was  socialists don t go to cuba despite it being socialist  and argued in the defense of it being a poor country  that it is socialism that does this  your statement is therefore only valid if your argument towards that is as well  and    well  it wasn t  that s all i pointed out  p
you re the reactionary one here  pal and yes she deserved to go to jail and sundiata didn t   and i did show proof also did most of the work in this conversation
it s not hypocritical because communists make arguments in favor of communism while in capitalist countries and it is not the other way around  no one moves to communist countries they just bother capitalists  meanwhile people move out of communist countries to capitalist countries in droves  you re arguing straw men with loaded questions  i can t speak for vietnam  but cuba was definitely better and only one thing made it worse  communism
 the woman who simply filmed a protest deserves to go to jail  the murderer terrorist who killed an officer and was affiliated to an armed political organization does not   oh but i am the reactionary one      thank you for showing the world your true colors  go read mein kampt or something  fuck off you little hitler 
again  people don t move for an economic system  they move for how well it is in the country  you even accepted this point yourself just some comments earlier  so how come you now suddenly completly omit that  your objection was that socialism always  or generally  causes a country to do bad  which i disproved  just for you to backpaddle to the first argument   and even for your  people don t want to move to socialist countries  point  yes they do  tons of subreddits here are about moving or visiting  with dozens of people wanting to go to socialist countries  and i have already showcased to you earlier that a huge majority of people in eastern europe want socialism  do they just not count for your example     but either way  this doesn t matter at the end  i have already made my point before  people don t move to poorer countries  why should they    you can argue that cuba got worse after the socialist reforms  but that doesn t make it to  socialism makes every country poor    
lol the woman that engaged in counter revolutionary  cia psyops  is better than the panther who defended himself against a pig    you have hitlers book in your closet  fuck you and the  rd reich you little shit
show the emigration vs immigration numbers of socialist nations  put your money where your mouth is  disprove that people leave socialist nations at least double the amount that move in  since we both know the answer to this  i ll argue against what you ll predictably argue again  you think they do bad because of other reasons besides economic  ok  prove it  prove that these countries overall quality of life is caused by things other than communism
show me proof she was working for the cia  i dare you  i double dare you  you don t have cojones to show a factible proof because there is none  you fascist always gaslighting people when they don t agree with your bullshit  straight from hitler s playbook 
firstly  again  backpaddling and ignoring my actual argument  never said more people emigrated  p  secondly  i already did  at several times  on the other hand  i would love some proof from you for a change  considering you are the one making the assertions here   if you want a recap     capitalist countries extort  invade  plunder  sanction  colonialise and imperialise other countries  this will make themselves richer  while others poorer  this is a fact  or are you just gonna ignore away all the damage centuries of colonialization did     socialist countries  on average  have a statistically higher quality of life and economies than their capitalist counterparts when actually compared under equal development   and those don t even include factors outside of equal development that make it drastically harder for socialist countries  such as more invasions  sanctions etc    same development is hereby important  due to the simple fact that the majority of countries that went for socialism  were already poor to begin with  comparing poor vs rich countries on the premise of  socialism vs capitalism  is just ingenuine     prior socialist countries  again on average  have a worse economical and quality of life development after reforming to capitalism  this is even true by now     the majority of people who lived in prior socialist countries  want a return of socialism   again  your original statement all hinges on one single argument  that being  the concept of socialism  when applied  inheritly makes countries poorer on a global basis  or poorer than when using capitalism   i disproved this stance  thoroughly  i hope 
   i never agreed on this  you re asserting definitions i don t agree with  capitalism does not imply extortion  invasion  plundering  and sanctioning by default  that s not what capitalism is  centuries of colonialization    is not an economic system  ussr and china is an imperial power by that logic  and    doesn t inherently imply damage and destruction       socialist countries on average have a higher quality of life  lol prove this      hmm nope  you re asserting bs with no facts and numbers    also  i argued that socialism makes countries worse in every way  be it freedom  economy  food  media  art  you name it  i don t give a fuck that russia went to space when millions were murdered to get there 
   how does the definition matter here  if those are things that clearly happened  what  are they now not colonial powers because you said so  having colonies made them rich  and the exploited ones poor  that s a fact  you can t just deny this without giving any credential argument     official world bank data  you can just cross reference them  if you want a paper on that  which comprises that information specifically for ussr countries  then  here you go  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc        pdf amjph           pdf      this is just the same point as    unless you want to specify something else
because they didn t clearly happen       it only measured health and education  go figure      yeah all your arguments are assertions which presuppose like largeeeee swaths of information in which you just keep contradicting yourself lol  it s kinda pathetic to anyone with a high iq but i ll break it down for you    you argue that nobody moves to socialist countries because they re poor and they want to be in the richer countries  then you argue that socialist countries actually have better qualities of life  you can t have both my dude  my point remains  if the quality of life is better then fuckin go and leave the capitalist countries to the people who like it
oh wow  colonialization denial is a new one    but what can i expect from somebody who forgot slavery existed     high iq   jesus christ        correct  the paper goes over education  healthcare  and safety in regards to life expectency  as well as nutritional values  aka  less starvation   so  you know  basic human needs that should be covered  i am not sure what argument you are trying to make here by saying  so what  they just had better basic living standards   those things are positive    other points to mention are also the inclusion of free housing  aka  basically zero homelessness  and better employment rates  that haven t been covered in this specific paper  you have yet to give an argument how those are bad things or how other points would make them worse than capitalist countries with equal development      oh no    i am actually giving stats to back up my information    how horrible    this is supposed to be a bad thing      you seem to misunderstand the point  the argument is not  socialist countries are better off on average than capitalist countries   as again  this completly undermines any historic context  but rather  the argument is a more nuanced one  being  socialist countries are better off on average than their capitalist counterparts   aka  countries with equal development  again  the point here is to not compare a country that was barely keeping alive and a literal slave state just   months ago  to a country such as the uk that has imperialised and plundered dozens of other countries for centuries    this is like the  th time i had to re clarify this point  if you can t handle historic context or proper scientific analysis  then this argument is pointless 
i never denied colonization  i also never denied slavery  i deny that capitalist countries  exploit invade plunder sanction etc  as i said before  your definitions and arguments presuppose a lot of things that are controversial and not everyone agrees on       because most socialist dictators pour all their resources into things that yield  numbers  such as education  and healthcare  very basic things  they don t care about anything else lol  they centrally plan economies which result in all types of inefficiencies    your stats are very subjective as i can provide stats that counter them  not your cherry picked study with false conclusions and presupposed definitions    again  as i keep saying  i m not ignoring any historical context but you re presupposing way too much  does that ever ring a bell in your mind or do you just remain ignorant to keep forcing your point home  you cannot argue for a by asserting things that i haven t agreed with  i don t agree that socialist nations are better off than their capitalist counterparts  equal development   instead of getting me to agree you are claiming i m arguing a fallacy because you presuppose that a and b and c are already established in your logical proof  nuance doesn t fuckin matter when my argument doesn t need to presuppose anything  communists advocating for communism but rarely if not never moving to communist nations is very telling  your counter argument that it s because capitalist countries plundered other ones  that s a non sequitur  address the actual problem rather than creating an easy straw man  why do communists not live in communist countries  the basic needs are met right  it s because the quality of life is worse right  we can argue this but u cannot move goalposts and contradict yourself by saying  it s cuz socialist nations are exploited so no one wants to be there  but actually the quality of life is better than capitalist countries  like address the problem dude 
anything that you want to do that is productive and fulfilling is a good ec
this place is in boston but it s the jam  i heard from their head plastic surgeon  dr  singhal  who spoke at the lymphedema conference this year  and wow  incredible standard of care  start to finish  what they re doing and how they re doing it is cutting edge   https   www bidmc org centers and departments plastic and reconstructive surgery programs and services lymphatic center programs and services
check out your local nci cancer center s   not all of them will have a surgeon who does the surgery  but they are likely to off some suggestions 
i m in florida but had the vlnt surgery last october and   it didn t really produce any results  it s tough to say bc i ve been militant about pumping and wrapping  even tho was told i wouldn t have to  so my feet ankles calves are down slightly but will go back to their usual degree of swollen if i don t  i m completely disappointed and can t help but feel lied to by the medical community  seems so money driven  i m left with scars and debt  i know another person who posts about lymphedema on reddit who had the same  read  no  results but when i research the procedure it appears to have great success  just my experience 
know it s a hike but my surgery was done at beth israel in boston and very worth it  amazing team   but i m only in newport ri so just  hrs  i d say check out the le rn website for ny   
no  but glad to know you re here  i m in jersey  is this an oral or topical or iv med  so glad to hear there is something
it s an inspiration listening to you all  did you manage to get insurance coverage for any of this 
this facility is excellent  but if you re dealing with lymphedema and have a relatively high bmi or are dealing with secondary illness  you may not qualify for surgical options  i m actively working to lose weight to meet their criteria  while i m not extremely overweight  i m currently outside their preferred range  the next steps  after achieving weight loss and ensuring i m in remission  involve further testing to potentially qualify for liposuction and then for lva or similar procedures   additionally  they are extremely busy  it took nearly a year to secure my initial consultation  and it was disheartening to learn that my bmi did not meet their requirements  my weight gain was significantly influenced by chemotherapy and steroids  and it s believed that the chemotherapy and cancer triggered my lymphedema  which limited my activity levels   i wanted to share my experience to highlight that qualifying is not straightforward  and not everyone will meet the criteria  prepare as well as you can  and i wish you the best in your journey 
its good to hear that beth israel is doing some good things  thank you so much   did you have the procedure done there 
dr singhal did my debulking surgery and his team is on point  
dr singhal was the beginning of le rn thankfully for us  i m happy to have been his patient 
that is helpful thank you  
i m sorry to hear that your experience hasn t been as successful as you hoped that is really frustrating  oh the medical community somehow so money driven while also being so stingy with even covering surgeries  is it possible for you since its been less than a year that it may just need more time to compensate stabilize  not to say you haven t already thought about that and even still not seeing the results you want or were told you should have can be so disheartening    i find myself sometimes oscillating back and forth   i don t have pain so if i can manage better with mld   better compression  maybe i should just try that instead of surgery  but when i see the surgical results  of the most successful ones  of course i get excited and feel like i should go that route    the consultations i ve had have told me that based on my stage  stage    i d need the lipo first because the others  vlnt  lva  on their own wouldn t be as successful  but i m trying cdt again this year  found out from a new therapist that the old one didn t do it nearly as well as they could ve based on my description   so for the sake of money  body  recovery i ll be trying that first    would you mind letting me know where in fl you got it done  the place i have had the consultation with was in fl so i m curious to see if its the same place 
actually i looked at train tickets  i m a bit tired of flying at this point with the trial lol  and its not too bad far  my main concern was if i could travel back to ny after the surgery by train vs  have to stay in boston for a few weeks post op   did you stay in boston post surgery post op  and other than reduction  which of course is the main goal so i m so glad it sounds like the surgery went well   did you find your need for compression has changed lessened 
its an oral medication  the have slowly increased my dose overtime  to make sure my liver in particular was tolerating it   so now i m up to   days week    message me if you d like more details   they are moving into the next phase which hopefully either gets pushed to the fda sooner or will have more trial spots across the country  so people can be treated but not have to shoulder the financial burden of going to ca every   months  
thank you   i want so badly for all of us to get more relief  insurance covered everything in the trial in terms of the visits  with a     copay for each visit for me  but i had to pay for my flights and lodgings  about      per trip where i would fly in the morning before the appt  have the appt the next day and then fly out that night     thats why i m hoping they approve the next phase with more clinics so folks don t have to shoulder that travel burden  i am by no means wealthy of funds  i just saved      each paycheck and dipped a bit into savings and made it work   so it can be done  
you re right  having to get yourself to a good surgery point with blood and water flow is very important with any lymphedema surgery  a close friend of mine had arm and she was on too many medications that  yrs later she is only being considered for surgery if she can come off some  cancer steroid meds mostly  
thank you for this note   its a good point for qualifications and where that might be more stringent  i think i d be ok bmi wise  but its good to know as well to start the process asap because it sounds like it can be at least   years out from finding the place consulting and the actual surgery 
yeah   cool  i d love to hear more about your experience  i m a pretty new lymphedema therapist and i have yet to work on tissue that has had this done  i don t know what it feels like  mind if i dm you with a couple questions 
that s so cool  he seemed kind and curious  my favorite kind of doctor    he showed a video clip of surgery  and lymph successfully flowing through a new established channel  during his presentation and i may have been on the edge of my seat  haha
thank you for your kind response  yes  it is possible i haven t waited long enough  but surely i d see some change    i got it done at advent health in orlando   that s crazy because i am stage   and was told to get the vlnt and  then  a possible lipo 
compressions got smaller but very important i still have to wear them  it is much more comfortable   confident now though  supposed to wear doubles but my leg has been doing so good with just one thankfully  i can also go about     days without wearing any and still be good    yeah the train   flights are not cheap   very annoying  so frequently  my post op check up was a month out   then were about every  months  if i remember correctly  and it was   days best outcome  in hospital for debulking surgery   dr singhal   his team are amazing   not sure about your insurance  i m very lucky with mine thankfully  but getting compressions at such a smaller size level is harder with    spent   i would still get onto le rn s website and see who their options are for ny  might find surgeon near you or somebody that will pay for all travel    lymphedema is annoying honestly lol i ve had a lot medically but lymphin is still my most hated haha
well heres hoping time will offer you a beautiful surprise of more progress    thats so wild   i can t say that i know the full complexity of the lymphatics but based on all the research i ve done it seems like it would make the most sense to start by removing the solids that aren t going anywhere otherwise  letting the body heal and then doing a vlnt or lva as a corrective measure  i m still crossing my fingers for you that it will lessen with more time but that is a really interesting choice they made    i realize sympathize with your frustration though   not that it is at all as taxing as surgery but when i went for cdt for the first time  and only time thus far   they didn t wrap me  like huh  i knew something was wrong this wasn t the complete therapy  they had me do exercises  used a pump and massage   but i didn t know enough at the time to ask more  the crazy part is that they still charged my insurance for the wraps  so that money gone and while the medicine i m on has helped with improvement  i never got the gold standard to start me off at a better place    here is to us both having some better luck and providers moving forward 
sounds like it was worth it though  do you mind me asking what stage you were in 
late stage unfortunately  had my hips replaced  separately  in      and lymphedema started creeping up in      but not noticed until        then covid hit and my surgery was scheduled for       had to wait until      to get it  with covid and then my vitals were never on point it just delayed it but end result worked out for me   message me and i ll send you photos of it all if you want  along with references   dirty details lol
i m so glad it worked out for you even through what sounds like many years of back and forth  i will definitely message thank you 
i m not sure i understand your post  but that ny times  piece  are we talking too much about mental health   is really interesting  thanks for sharing 
 oppositional defiant disorder   exacerbates the stigma surrounding reactive behavior and frames normal reactions to trauma as personal issues of self control   pathologizes resistance to injustice   https   en wikipedia org wiki oppositional defiant disorder wprov sfla      of my false arrests were for disobediently saying no and criticizing abusive racist parents  the first in high school was for calling the very boring english teacher an  opponent or rival  
dam that s some old news but what s even worse is that no one cared when the news was released
you know what s the most confusing thing about this to me is that there is never coverage on the patent situation  the base patent rights should be being talked about and arguments were heard in appeals court this week  the valuation of this company is a real head scratcher given the current patent rights 
it s actually not old news   the last time editas reported on the edit     brilliance trial was back on november            the article that i posted was an updated findings that were reported on may  th in the new england journal of medicine

i know someone who got accepted into st  and a phd programme the same year   caused a huge issue because the deanery insisted they have at least one arcp without concerns before they would consider allowing an oopr  after initially saying it would be fine   they had to pass on a fully funded phd to keep their training number   i d check the gold guide in case this is different between deaneries but i suspect not 
       oop will not normally be agreed until a trainee has been in a training programme for at least one year of specialty training  unless at the time of appointment  deferral of the start of the programme has been agreed for leave on statutory grounds   occasions where oop is granted to trainees in core training programmes are likely to be exceptional given the length and nature of their training       https   www copmed org uk images docs gold guide  th edition gold guide  th edition august      pdf  https   www copmed org uk images docs gold guide  th edition gold guide  th edition august      pdf     it sounds like what you are suggesting probably wouldn t be possible  you could approach the tpd about it if you get an st offer and see what they say about it 
i did this  they weren t thrilled about it but let me do it anyway
i don t have an answer to your question   but the way i see it  if it s a fully funded phd  it will increase your chances of getting the st when you finally afterwards   i m not sure how phd funding works  but could you get it next year if you don t want to give up your hst ntn 
well done  how much time did you have to defer training      years 
  years  fully funded phd like yours 
that s amazing congrats  there is hope   
i m interested in this  saline should have a more neutral ph and be more comfortable  this is very obvious in other clinical procedures  ph and temperature of anesthetic matters      is a really low number for clinical relevance outside of showing it should be research more   it s really easy to reconstitute   bottles and check for yourself   i ve seen people here say both works better   the innotox i use burns for sure  i assumed it is the bacteria static nature doing it  maybe this is wrong but i have not done a side by side yet 
is there a place to even buy bac stat saline   a couple of years ago  i had no problems finding it  and now a prescription is required and bacteriostatic water seems to be the only option if we want to reconstitute with something that is preserved 
  i m getting ready to reconstitute nabota  i used the green bac saline last time   it burned like crazy  the blue is the solution the company sent with it   pink is bac water  which one can i use that won t burn   tia 
just did botox training today  they mentioned this 
i have used mostly saline     and no difference  of course i used some numbing cream  very lightly  prior
you re right  ph is extremely important  i have never seen so many comments suggesting that innotox burns stings as i have recently  thanks for your feedback  would you be willing to try a different toxin to avoid the sting associated with innotox  just to clarity  it seems not everyone experiences the sting of innotox  however  it does seem to be very common however 
it s not only because of the ph  saline solution is an  isotonic solution with     nacl concentration that mimics the cell plasma in human body  distilled  water for injection contains nothing   the body recognizes it as a foreign substance and sends a pain response to the brain 
lol don t do bac water  i ve done it before and when i tell you it burns like lava  i mean it   i m inquiring with some of my vendors right now to see if someone will be able to carry it  would be nice to have easy access to it through a reputable company 
oh nice  did they say bac saline was less painful thanks for sharing 
opinions are all over the place but i was thinking of nabota next  i m not worried abt reconstitution  what do you suggest 
same  never  ever again  it was torture 
it s awful    
yes they did 
if you re not aware  it s easy to assume bac water and bac saline are the same  you and i both not lol that s far from the case 
i didn t know the difference   i know the companies typically include or sell bacteriostatic water   i did now see it was bacteriostatic saline and not bacteriostatic water   bac water is what they sell and you are saying not to use it 
good to know  i ve been making this mistake 
i will never use water again  i thought i was dying and i have a pretty high pain tolerance  i didn t even complete my   s before abandoning it  i used it for microneedling and it was fine  but injections  no way

i m sorry to say  that nothing has helped mine  i did tepezza and steroid infusions and that didn t work  i had surgery and that worked for   months and the double vision came back  my u derstandong is that surgery won t help unless the thyroid eye disease is either in remission or at least stable   good luck 
i had   infusions of solumedrol off    mcg and   infusions of    mcg and it kinda did help tbh  but im scared that they will come back out  i already had my thyroid fully removed but the eyes can still continue to bulge but yeah
just to provide some positivity  i believe it can get better on its own when thyroid hormone and antibodies are stable  if it doesn t which is possible that s when ods is a viable option for the appearance aspect and possibly for the vision aspect as well  although people do have worsening double visions sometimes  people tend to see improvement as well  when it comes to tepezza from what i hear is that it works but can also can have some pretty severe side effects 
surgery doesn t cure proptosis  it just creates more space around the eyes so it doesn t add pressure to the optic nerve  or it helps with the aesthetics 
no 
same i ve been stuck with my bulging eyes for   years already  i haven t tried the surgery but my doctor is suggesting it after   months  idk if this is a good idea still 
orbital decompression most definitely will reduce proptosis  in terms of a it being a  cure  yeah it s not a cure but it can provide symmetry with your eyes and reduce that bulging look  the better the surgeon the better the outcome  if your antibodies are low and ted is in the inactive phase as well as thyroid hormone being normal and healthy this surgery is a viable option  double vision dosent always happen in everyone s case either it varies 
as usual   great post uws   we will win this   standing by tightlines
hello uws  excellent thought out post  i really appreciate you taking the time    i believe that the cost of a lab that is published is sort of like the wac price of pharmaceuticals  that meaning those rates are extremely negotiable and if you have a plan  it s greatly reduced   for example  if i were to go and get labs done on my dime  i would pay hundreds of dollars for a simple lab test  but having benefits that have been negotiated rates  those prices are substantially lower   i m hoping this is the case with our clinical trials  we will have negotiated contract rates well below the published price   but that s just my guess  and my hope   i believe it is difficult to wait  but understand the process and what is unfolding in front of us    i  like most longs   continue accumulate with  these low prices and i believe the worse is behind and the future looks extremely bright   glta

patience to all longs  still here  always 
hey brother  great seeing you   for     do you think it is still feasible that the first patient be enrolled by late june   for     i was thinking the cro would be the most expensive part   those costs for the labs are likely negotiated with by the paying insurance company and are probably less than half of the maximum listed   still  it s a hell of a lot of money for blood work     for      on pasc  long covid  long haulers  https   www sciencedirect com science article pii s               x       merck may not be involved  especially  if cytodyn is paying   antonio migliarese      however  could we perform some sort of preclinical trial combination therapy with another drug  such as madrigal or one of the other players out there that s further ahead than us in the game  and so i think what we re getting at is identifying these preclinical studies  which are significantly cheaper in the          to          range could lead to some potential partnerships and credibility with some of the other larger pharmas  which could then help propel us within these other spaces with well investing limited funds  so just saying that  i think help people understand as we ve been going through this clinical hold process and the process that we re in the middle of right now is coming up with a judicious plan  which we think we can utilize the least amount of capital to create the greatest number of catalysts for the company  which we re very much in need of as we ve been working through the hold      and i love the lastly  especially       the chapters that will be written will change everything for all of us and imo the story of ll will be bigger than keytruda and humira combined      
i m all in 
want to see why we do this check out on ig  loyloveslife
excellent  uws  thank you   putting things in that perspective helps keep my impatience in check  i ve only been long for around   years and have a pretty decent cost basis from accumulating   i can only imagine what a pull this is for people who got in earlier in the story  hang in there  longs 
uws   a terrific outline of where we are at the moment   with emphasis on  don t get sore   buy some more    while  at the back of my mind     i remember  negotiated settlement 
word from the back channels is the trial is estimated at       million 
thank you sir  always a pleasure to hear from you  great reverse engineering for those cost estimates 
we are all together my brother
that idea of a contract price with a lab that performs the assays makes total sense  i hope that is something that is being worked on  thank you professional art
wow  you gotta shop around for a good deal with the interleukin test 
love it jsinvest  we stand together with a boat load of other longs 
i may not have estimated the cro part with a lot of thought  somebody has to aggregate all of the labs  input the results and identify trends and calculate p values  some of that is performed by a biostatistics person and at one point we had a full time biostatistician  not sure anymore  
i m right there with you  all in for the win 
perfectly stated my brother  dr  jl is doing all the right things
that is a great reminder expensive tea  i hope that just pops soon  i have the arbitration trial in my head as november  but as you stated  settlement  can happen anytime  
always wondered who is your back channels  but that being said  it all depends on what array of biomarkers they want to study and how much it costs to perform the associated biomarker assays  my estimate is really rough and the interleukin test estimate from my physician provided a clue that i was on the low end of the spectrum  your back channels could be right on this one
