what if mike never went to prison       one of the big plot points later on in suits was when mike finally got outed for his secret of having never been to harvard or any law school and going to prison for fraud  the one responsible for this was anita gibbs and she was seen multiple times after mike went to prison  most notably she was on the character and fitness committee for the new york bar in season   s finale       but one thing i ve been asking myself is what would ve happened if mike had not gone to prison in season    now one scenario i could see is mike actually trusting harvey and the trial proceeds with the jury returning a not guilty verdict       however  with everything on the line i believe harvey would ve been more than willing to try and get the jury to believe that anita was attempting to force mike to commit perjury  towards the end of the trial  originally when mike confessed to being a fraud  he would instead tell the jury that anita gibbs had told him to lie in court and tell the jury he was a fraud  and harvey would likely have someone testify that this was the case       in the end  mike would still be found not guilty  anita would likely lose her career and become an adversary to the firm  this would mean mike isn t in prison for season   but would likely not go back to pearson specter  because before his arrest mike had resigned so it s likely that he would potentially find himself working at the clinic a little earlier       but those are my rough thoughts  i honestly think there were several ways that mike could ve gotten out of going to prison,"Hello,
